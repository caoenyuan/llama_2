      " Inconel 625 sustainable milling surface integrity and the dependence on alloy processing route\n",
      " Abstract: The discovery of deepwater oil and gas sources has altered the scenario of world production of oil products, attracting even more attention to nickel superalloys. However, this class of materials can be used in several applications. Furthermore, nickel superalloys are highly dependent on their processing history, and the manner in which superalloys react to machining can directly affect the finished product. This work aims to evaluate the surface integrity of two different materials after cryogenic side-milling in conditions that stimulate severe plastic deformation (SPD) and high heat generation. The results show that the material response to machining depends strongly on the pre-processing route instead of most assumptions. While cryogenic cooling led to significant sub-surface hardness and microstructural changes in wrought Inconel 625 alloy, such changes were not observed for clad Inconel 625. Therefore, in order to achieve significant surface integrity changes, process parameters need to be selected and optimized accordingly. Also, the findings indicate that some new factors established significant affect/change surface integrity: (a) SPD through a high r_β/h ratio; (b) the specific pre-processing thermomechanical history of the workpiece material; and (c) and cryogenic cooling, by changing material properties, reducing temperature and altering cutting phenomena and chip formation. </s> \n"

      " Effect of cryogenic cooling on residual stresses and surface finish of 316L during hybrid manufacturing\n",
      " Abstract:   In this work, the effect of cryogenic cooling (CC) on residual stress and surface roughness is investigated in a hybrid additive manufactured part. A 3D printed stainless steel (SS) component was subjected to CC treatment using liquid nitrogen (LN2). Residual stress measurements were carried out by X-ray diffraction method and surface roughness analysis was performed with white light interferometry technique. The results show that the residual stress profile decreases significantly after CC treatment. Surface roughness also reduces considerably due to the removal of oxide layer formed at the interface between LN2 and SS. This study demonstrates that CC can be used as an effective post processing step for improving mechanical properties and surface quality of AM parts.\n"
