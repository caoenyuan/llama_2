        "abstract": "A study was conducted on some spring, river and well waters in parts of Nigeria to assess their discharge characteristics, processes controlling water chemistry, reservoir temperature and utilization for drinking and irrigation purposes. The study area lies in Yankari Games Reserve (YGR), underlain by Cretaceous Sandstone characterized by warm springs in northeastern Nigeria and Cross River State (CRS), underlain by Precambrian–Tertiary sediments of southeastern Nigeria, characterized by cold springs. The average discharge for the springs and rivers in the YGR were 2.74±2.07 and 89.42±74.49 m^3/sec, respectively. In the CRS, average discharges for the springs and artesian wells were 0.00011±0.000006 and 0.005 m^3/sec, respectively. Piper diagram suggests that the waters belongs to Na^2+–HCO_3^− and Na^2+–Cl^− facies. The water chemistry is controlled mainly by silicate (albite) weathering and ion exchange. The ternary diagram indicates that most of the waters (85%) plotted in the bicarbonate field are classified as peripheral water, while 15% plotted in the chloride field are classified as matured water. Chemical geothermometry showed wide variation in estimated reservoir temperature, which varied between 14 and 190°C with a mean value of 104.83±61.20°C for the YGR area. These results are unreliable since the calculated temperatures are lower than the measured field temperatures. The water is saturated with goethite (FeOOH), hematite (Fe_2O_3) and near saturated with respect to calcite (CaCO_3), aragonite (CaCO_3), siderite (FeCO_3) and rhodochrosite (MnCO_3). Overall results revealed that water quality is suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes."

        "abstract": "Bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motors can rely on the radial electromagnetic force generated by magnetic field coupling to achieve active suspension. However, the coupling between magnetic fields may lead to the saturation of the magnetic circuit, which affects the stability of motor suspension force and is one of the key problems to be solved for bearingless motors. In order to investigate the effect of magnetic circuit saturation on the suspension performance, firstly, the equation of the radial suspension force is derived by combining the influence of the magnetic circuit saturation on the parameters of the motor. The relationship of the magnetic circuit saturation on the stable and fluctuating components of the radial suspension force is obtained, and the fluctuation mechanism of the suspension force under the saturation state is revealed. Secondly, the radial suspension force in different saturation states of the magnetic circuit is calculated by finite element calculation method. Combining the effect of magnetic flux density on the magnetic permeability, the variation of the magnitude and fluctuating of the suspension force with the magnetic field in different magnetic circuit saturation states is given. Finally, the accuracy of the analytical and finite element calculations is demonstrated experimentally."

Structural and morphological analyses were accomplished by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM). The crystallite size and lattice parameter followed a decreasing trend up on increase in Dy^3+ substitution for the concentration x  ≤ 0.15, which is due to the hindrance in crystallite growth and deposition of Dy^3+ on grain boundaries, respectively. The lattice strain was increased from 5.027 to 8.814 × $${10}^{-3}$$ 10 - 3 with enhancement in Dy^3+ content. The morphological studies showed uniform distribution of particles with slight agglomeration and the average particle size was calculated to be 22.17 nm, which is in good agreement with XRD results. The magnetic studies were executed by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) over a wide range of applied magnetic field. The soft ferrimagnetic nature of these ferrites was revealed by narrow (M–H) curve. The magnetic parameters exhibited decreasing behavior upon increasing amount of substitution. The coercivity ( H _ c ) was recorded to be 1097 Oe for x  = 0.00 and saturation magnetization ( M _ s ) was calculated in the range 27.04–40.86 emu/g. The anisotropy constant and magneton number were found to be in the range of 9887–46,703 erg/cm^3 and 1.21–1.71 µ_B, respectively. These properties of prepared ferrites point towards their applicability in magnetic recording instruments, memory, and high-density data storage devices."

        "abstract": "Microwave irradiation is a promising auxiliary method in excavation of frozen rock. Microwave irradiation heating melts frozen sandstone completely within only 40 s. Unfrozen water in frozen sandstone is the fundamental cause of the rapid melting. Softening effect on frozen sandstone is enhanced by increasing saturation degree. The strength and hardness of rock are much higher at freezing temperatures than at room temperature. This results in high excavation costs and low excavation efficiency in frozen rock layers. This study proposes a novel way to thaw porous and water-bearing rock by microwave irradiation. It is applicable to a wide range of strata and is not dependent on whether the rock contains wave-absorbing minerals. Quartz sandstone specimens free from absorbing minerals and of different saturation levels were used in an investigation of thawing and softening behaviors under microwave irradiation. The rock pore structures were observed before and after irradiation. The results show that (1) frozen quartz sandstone irradiated by microwaves undergoes three stages: (i) rapid melting of pore ice, (ii) intense vaporization of meltwater, and (iii) drying. (2) Microwave irradiation significantly reduces the strength of frozen quartz sandstone. (3) The mechanisms are vaporization expansion , which causes the propagation of intergranular cracks, and thermal expansion , which induces trans-granular cracking. (4) Softening of 40–100%-saturated frozen quartz sandstone is caused by both vapor and thermal expansion, while 0–40%-saturated sandstone is mainly affected by thermal expansion. This study provides theoretical and experimental support for microwave-assisted breakage of frozen porous and water-bearing rock."

Sol-gel route was used for the fabrication of Sr_0.6 Zn_0.4 Gd_x Fe_2- x O_4 (0.00, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075, 0.100) ferrites. The structural, magnetic, microwave, and DC (direct current) properties of prepared Nps were found using of number characterization techniques. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Sr_0.6 Zn_0.4 Gd_ x Fe_2- x O_4 SFs showed a single cubic phase. The magnetic behavior was determined by applying a field of 2 kOe. The various magnetic features, including those determined based on the M-H loop, and prepared spinel ferrites showed the soft nature of magnetic materials. When amount of gadolinium (Gd) is increased, then saturation magnetization, coercivity, remanence magnetization is decreased. The Ms values decreased from 69.36 to 32.18 emu/g, coercivity reduced from 220 to 14 emu/g, and remanence magnetization is decreased from 32 to 3 emu/g. The electrical parameters revealed that direct current resistivity and activation energy (Ea) increased (from 0.16 eV to 0.28eV) with the inclusion of the Gd. The activation energy was increased from 0.16 to 0.28 eV. The dielectric constant and loss of permittivity and permeability were determined by applying the frequency 5.5–9.5 GHz. From the above enhanced parameters, it can be concluded that fabricated SFs may be suitable for high-frequency devices."

        "abstract": "Purpose The degree and dynamic progression of neuroinflammation after traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI) are crucial determinants of the severity of injury and potential for recovery. We used Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to monitor neuroinflammation longitudinally, correlating it with Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and behavior in contusion-injured rats. These studies help validate CEST metrics and confirm how imaging may be used to evaluate the efficacy of therapies and understand their mechanisms of action. Procedures 12 SCI and 4 sham surgery rats were subjected to CEST MRI and PET-Translocator Protein (TSPO) scans for 8 weeks following injury. Z-spectra from the SCI were analyzed using a 5-Lorentzian pool model for fitting. Weekly motor and somatosensory behavior were correlated with imaging metrics, which were validated through post-mortem histological and immuo-staining using ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein-1 (iba-1, microglia) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, astrocytes). Results PET-TSPO showed widespread inflammation and post-mortem histology confirmed the presence of activated microglia. Changes in CEST and nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) peaks at 3.5 ppm and -1.6 ppm respectively were largest within the first week after injury and more pronounced in rostral versus caudal segments. These temporal indices of neuroinflammation corresponded to the recovery of locomotor behaviors and somatic sensation in rats with moderate contusion injury. The results confirm that CEST MRI metrics are sensitive indices of states of neuroinflammation within injured spinal cords. Conclusions The detection of dynamic spatiotemporal features of neuroinflammation progression underscores the importance of considering their timings and locations for neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory therapies. The availability of noninvasive MRI indices of neuroinflammation may facilitate clinical trials aimed at treatments that promote recovery after SCI."

The tongue is suggested as a possible anatomical site causing airway obstruction. However, the role of other pharyngeal structures in the development of OSA remains unclear. We designed a study using both the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) and the oxygen saturation measurements to assess the severity of OSA. We aimed to identify critical anatomical structures of the upper airway that correlate with the severity of OSA and to evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers to detect possible OSA in patients without overt symptoms. Materials and methods The study included participants referred to the neurology outpatient clinic from the check-up unit. Participants were grouped as controls, mild, moderate, or severe OSA according to the AHI. A cranial MRI with a field of view (FOV) encompassing the upper airway structures was obtained from all participants. The areas of the tongue and the uvula were measured on the sagittal images by drawing the boundaries of the tissues manually. The posterior air space (PAS) area was evaluated from regions of interest in five parallel planes. Results Of 105 participants, 30 were controls, 27 had mild, 25 had moderate, and 23 had severe OSA. The moderate and severe OSA groups did not differ in oxygen saturation levels during sleep. Therefore, patients with moderate and severe OSA were combined into one group (moderate/severe OSA). The area of the tongue was significantly larger in the moderate/severe OSA group compared to the control group. Both the tongue and the uvula areas showed a significant positive correlation with the AHI. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the tongue and uvula have prominent roles in the severity of OSAS. It may be useful to measure these structures with MRI to screen for at-risk individuals without overt OSA symptoms."

Single-phase nano-structured ferrites with varying amounts of Eu were synthesized using the sol–gel technique. The crystalline characteristics were identified using x-ray diffraction (XRD) testing, which demonstrated a rise in lattice parameters as the Eu concentration increased. The DC (direct current) resistivity measurements showed that the samples exhibit a semiconducting behavior, with a decrease in resistance at elevated temperatures. We found that the measured magnetic properties of magnetic saturation ( M _s), remanence magnetization ( M _r), and coercivity ( H _c) were all impacted by the presence of Eu substitution. The saturation magnetization and remanence magnetization decreased while the coercivity increased, making the Eu-doped Cu-Zn spinel ferrites efficient magnetic semiconductors.

Nanocrystalline Co and Fe particles in the AlN matrix could lead to the development of a material for the above applications. In this study, we investigated anneal-induced magnetic and electric properties with respect to changes in microstructure as well as Fe content in the AlN-Co and AlN-Fe thin films. AlN-Co and AlN-Fe thin films were reactively deposited with two different combinations of targets, such as Al-Co_50Fe_50 (Case-I) and Al-Co_20Fe_80 (Case-II) targets, in a two-facing-target type dc sputtering (TFTS) system and their structural changes were investigated together with magnetic and electrical property changes. The saturation magnetization increases with increasing annealing temperature on account of the formation of magnetic phases after annealing. The films prepared with Al-Co_50Fe_50 target combination show a higher magnetization and a smaller coercivity than the films prepared with Al-Co_20Fe_80 target combination. The resistivity decreases with increasing annealing time and temperature for Case-I film but increases with annealing time and temperature for Case-II film attributed to the difference of the conducting component in the respective films. All the films show a semiconducting conduction mechanism except the annealed films prepared with Al-Co_50Fe_50 target combination, which shows an ohmic conduction mechanism."

        "abstract": "The 2013 ISCD consensus recommended a Caucasian female reference database for T -score calculation in men, which says “A uniform Caucasian (non-race adjusted) female reference database should be used to calculate T-scores for men of all ethnic groups.” However, this statement was recommended for the US population, and no position was taken with respect to BMD reference data or ethnicity matching outside of the USA. In East Asia, currently, a Japanese BMD reference database is universally adopted in Japan for clinical DXA diagnosis, while both local BMD and Caucasian BMD reference databases are in use in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. In this article, we argue that an ethnicity- and gender-specific BMD database should be used for T -score calculations for East Asians, and we list the justifications why we advocate so. Use of a Caucasian BMD reference database leads to systematically lower T -scores for East Asians and an overestimation of the prevalence of osteoporosis. Using a female BMD reference database to calculate T -scores for male patients leads to higher T -score values and an underestimation of the prevalence of osteoporosis. Epidemiological evidence does not support using a female BMD reference database to calculate T -scores for men. We also note that BMD reference databases collected in Asia should be critically evaluated for their quality."

Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze pressure drop fluctuations using statistical methods in order to propose simple tools to characterize the sub-regimes of the intermittent flow. The pressure drop time series were collected from experiments carried out using air–water mixture and 30 mm inner diameter pipe. The utilization of transparent pipes allowed to identify three sub-regimes which are plug flow, less aerated slug flow (LAS flow), and highly aerated slug flow (HAS flow). It was found that the probability density functions (PDF) displayed a unimodal distribution in all cases studied. Meanwhile, the representation of the base width and maximum values of PDF as functions of the gas-to-liquid superficial velocity ratio and the mixture Froude number, respectively, showed that the points for each sub-regime are clustered in the same zone. Therefore, these two feature spaces can be used to identify the sub-regimes. A third feature space, based on the statistical parameter standard deviation and kurtosis, was also proposed as a tool to distinguish between the three sub-regimes."

        "abstract": "The prevalence and severity of spine degenerative changes have been noted to be lower among older Chinese women than among older Caucasian women. Spine degenerative changes associated with marginal osteophytosis, trabecular thickening, subchondral sclerosis, facet joint arthrosis, and disc space narrowing can all lead to artificially higher spine areal bone mineral density (BMD). The lower prevalence and severity of spine degeneration have important implications for the interpretation of spine areal BMD reading for Chinese women. With fewer contributions from spine degenerative changes, following natural aging, the declines of population group means of spine BMD and T-score are faster for Chinese women than for Caucasian women. While a cutpoint T-score ≤ −2.5 for defining spine densitometric osteoporosis is recommended for Caucasian women, for Chinese women the same cutpoint T-score of ≤ −2.5 inflates the estimated osteoporosis prevalence based on spine BMD measure. In addition to the use of an ethnicity-specific BMD reference database, a stricter cutpoint T-score for defining spine densitometric osteoporosis among older Chinese women should be applied."

Materials and methods Patients with GCTB under denosumab treatment and monitored with CT and (DCE-)MRI (2012-2021) were retrospectively included. Imaging and (semi-)quantitative measurements were used to assess response/relapse. Tissue samples were analyzed using computerized segmentation for vascularization and number of neoplastic and giant cells. Pearson’s correlation/Spearman’s rank coefficient and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess correlations between histopathology and radiology. Results Six patients (28 ± 8years; five men) were evaluated. On CT, good responders showed progressive re-ossification (+7.8HU/month) and cortical remodeling (woven bone). MRI showed an SI decrease relative to muscle on T1-weighted (−0.01 A.U./month) and on fat-saturated T2-weighted sequences (−0.03 A.U./month). Time-intensity-curves evolved from a type IV with high first pass, high amplitude, and steep wash-out to a slow type II. An increase in time-to-peak (+100%) and a decrease in K trans (−71%) were observed. This is consistent with microscopic examination, showing a decrease of giant cells (−76%), neoplastic cells (-63%), and blood vessels (−28%). There was a strong statistical significant inverse correlation between time-to-peak and microvessel density ( ρ = −0.9, p = 0.01). Significantly less neoplastic ( p = 0.03) and giant cells ( p = 0.04) were found with a time-intensity curve type II, compared to a type IV. Two patients showed relapse after initial good response when stopping denosumab. Inverse imaging and pathological findings were observed. Conclusion CT and (DCE-)MRI show a good correlation with pathology and allow adequate evaluation of response to denosumab and detection of therapy failure."

        "abstract": "To understand the nature of xenon-induced recovery of the functional activity of pulmonary surfactant during inhalation of a gas mixture of Xe/O_2, the mechanisms of the ongoing processes were studied in silico . Impaired ability of pulmonary surfactant to maintain low surface tension preventing alveolar atelectasis occurs due to formation of aggregates of its phospholipids and a decrease in their lateral mobility. Aggregated lipid systems, whose structure can explain the loss of lateral mobility of surfactant phospholipids, were modeled in silico at the molecular level. Changes in the Gibbs energy and enthalpy in the reactions of the formation and decomposition of xenon intermediates with model systems of various compositions/structures were calculated. The simulation was carried out for atomic xenon and for xenon polarized by molecular oxygen in the gas phase and taking into account solvation with water. The loss of lateral mobility of phospholipids can be explained by specific features of electronic structure of hydrophobic hydrocarbon molecules (acyl chains), which, under certain conditions, are capable of forming structured common regions of the electrostatic potential, to which xenon has an affinity. In this case, inclusion coordination compounds of the “guest—host” type are formed, which subsequently decompose due to the nature of the polarization of the Xe atoms. The formation and decomposition of xenon intermediates in these systems lead to recovery of the lateral mobility (fluidity) of phospholipids, which restores functional activity of surfactant films."

Such a mist of microdroplets with controllable mist density has been used for Aerosol Jet® printing in the fabrication of a variety of additively manufactured microscale devices. Despite many unique capabilities demonstrated with the Aerosol Jet® printing technology, its ultrasonic atomization behavior appears to be rather sensitive to the ink properties with gaps in our understanding of the fundamental physics underlying its operation. In this work, we investigate some basic mechanisms in the Aerosol Jet® ultrasonic atomizer with a lumped-parameter kinetic coagulation model for highly concentrated mist. To mitigate the difficulty with unavailable knowledge about the complex turbulent flow inside the atomizer chamber, we present results for several orders of magnitude of the turbulent energy dissipation rates to examine a range of possibilities. The same approach is taken for analyzing the scavenging effect of the swirling bulk liquid. Our results also demonstrate the theoretical possibility for achieving a mist saturation condition where the mist output from the atomizer can become insensitive to process variables. As observed in experiments, such a saturated mist is highly desirable for Aerosol Jet® printing with maximized and well-controlled throughput in additive manufacturing."

In this paper, a VO_2@Pd nanowires gas sensor was synthesized using a combination of hydrothermal and annealing methods. The content of Pd in the as-prepared products was successfully controlled by adjusting the reaction parameters. The morphology and formation mechanism of VO_2 nanostructures were systematically evaluated. The response value of VO_2@Pd nanowires is 31.94 towards 5 ppm of NO_2, which is about 38.75% higher than that of pristine VO_2 at a relatively low temperature of 50°C. Furthermore, the sensor exhibits good selectivity, excellent response/recovery time, and superior stability towards NO_2. The significant enhancement of NO_2 sensing performance could be attributed to the electronic and chemical sensitization. Density functional theory (DFT) simulation suggests that both the adsorption energy and electron transfer between the VO_2@Pd substrate and NO_2 molecules are optimized synergistically, leading to the improved sensitivity of the gas sensor. Importantly, the strong orbital hybridization between the NO_2 molecule and Pd atom is observed according to density of states (DOS), which is beneficial in selectively improving the NO_2 sensing performance of the VO_2@Pd gas sensor."

To date, various integrated transformer structures and design techniques have been explored to adjust leakage inductance; however, they often require additional devices or complex winding structures, making it difficult to apply them to normal winding-type transformers. This study presents a new integrated transformer structure based on a winding-type transformer that allows to adjust the leakage inductance without additional devices through segments where primary and secondary windings are completely separated or partially overlapped. The proposed integrated transformer structure is manufactured using design techniques that consider not only efficiency and power density, but also reliability factors such as magnetic flux and temperature. The proposed structure and design techniques are validated through finite element analysis simulations and experiments with a 10 kW LLC resonant converter, which confirms the exact design value of the leakage inductance and ensures resonant operation, resulting in a highly efficient resonant converter."

        "abstract": "The influences of the doping of trace rare-earth element Dy on the structures and properties of Fe-Al magnetostrictive alloys were studied in this paper. The Fe_81Al_19Dy_x ( x  = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) series alloy samples were melted by using the vacuum arc-melting furnace. The microstructures of the alloy samples were comprehensively investigated by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The magnetostriction and magnetization properties of alloy samples were measured by Stain Gauge Method (SGM) and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), respectively. The research results show that the doping of trace rare-earth element Dy in the composition of Fe_81Al_19 alloy leads to a great improvement in the magnetostrictive properties of Fe_81Al_19 alloy. In Fe_81Al_19Dy_x ( x  = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) alloys, the maximum magnetostriction coefficient of the alloy with x  = 0.1 can reach 121 ppm, which is much greater than that of Fe_81Al_19 alloy (26 ppm). The enhancement of magnetostriction is mainly due to the fact that the doping of rare-earth element Dy promotes preferred orientation of Fe_81Al_19 alloy along the < 100 > crystal direction, which in turn makes the alloy have higher magnetocrystalline anisotropy."

        "abstract": "Arrays of Co nanowires of diameter ~ 200 nm have been prepared by electrodeposition into nanopores of anodic aluminum oxide templates. X-ray diffraction confirms that these nanowires consist of mostly hexagonal close-packed (hcp) or face-centered cubic (fcc) grains or a mixture of both. Scanning electron microscope confirms that these nanowires are continuous and parallel to each other. The effect of boric acid and pH on the structural and magnetic properties of electrodeposited cobalt nanowires has been studied. When boric acid is not introduced into the electrolyte, high concentration of hydrogen is liberated, which results into the formation of disordered fcc Co at low pH. The high value of coercivity for the nanowires deposited at low pH is attributed to the formation of higher fraction of disordered fcc Co nanowires. The induced anisotropy is weak at high pH compared to low pH. This is attributed to the competition between shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy of hcp phase."

The synthesized products were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and dc magnetization. The XRD spectra revealed the presence of secondary phases which reduced after thermal treatment resulting in the formation of single-phase polycrystalline FeCo. The FE-SEM micrographs confirmed the formation of impurities, which disappeared after thermal treatment, along with the substantial grain growth. The uniform distribution of the elements was confirmed through EDS spectra. The temperature and the magnetic field-dependent magnetization measurements under various conditions showed that, as a consequence of thermal treatment, the saturation magnetization and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy has been enhanced along with the generation of exchange bias. The phenomena of grain growth, formation of grain boundary and the exchange interactions have been described with the help of the proposed mechanism. In brief, the post-synthesis high-temperature thermal treatment induced structural as well as microstructural variations leading to the formation of grain boundaries. These grain boundaries provided interface regions for the occurrence of exchange interactions, which enhanced the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and induced exchange bias in nanocrystalline FeCo."

Pure cubic spinel phase was confirmed from the indexed planes in XRD patterns. The experimental lattice parameter ( a ) was found to be in the range of 8.3908–8.3509 Å in the decreasing order with the doping level of Al^3+ ions. The sharp diffraction peaks indicate the crystalline nature of the samples. The microwave sintering is promoting the crystallinity with the substitution of Al^3+ ions (42.8–54.4 nm). The saturation magnetization ( M _ s ) gradually decreased with the substitution of Al^3+ ions, and highest value of 61.2 emu/g was reported. The dilution of A–B superexchange interaction can be expected from the variation of bond angles. The coercivity is predominantly dependent on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Normal dielectric dispersion was observed in the present series of ferrite samples, and the dielectric constant is found to be composition dependent. The low value of dielectric constant was observed for the compositions x = 0.15 and x = 0.25. The present ferrite systems are showing good sensor response to NH_3 and least response to H_2. In the tested ferrite systems, the composition x = 0.25 is an appropriate selective for sensor fabrication to test NH_3 gas."

In this paper, a VO_2@Pd nanowires gas sensor was synthesized using a combination of hydrothermal and annealing methods. The content of Pd in the as-prepared products was successfully controlled by adjusting the reaction parameters. The morphology and formation mechanism of VO_2 nanostructures were systematically evaluated. The response value of VO_2@Pd nanowires is 31.94 towards 5 ppm of NO_2, which is about 38.75% higher than that of pristine VO_2 at a relatively low temperature of 50°C. Furthermore, the sensor exhibits good selectivity, excellent response/recovery time, and superior stability towards NO_2. The significant enhancement of NO_2 sensing performance could be attributed to the electronic and chemical sensitization. Density functional theory (DFT) simulation suggests that both the adsorption energy and electron transfer between the VO_2@Pd substrate and NO_2 molecules are optimized synergistically, leading to the improved sensitivity of the gas sensor. Importantly, the strong orbital hybridization between the NO_2 molecule and Pd atom is observed according to density of states (DOS), which is beneficial in selectively improving the NO_2 sensing performance of the VO_2@Pd gas sensor."

Blocking temperature is a remarkable quantity that allows one to determine the regime, superparamagnetic or blocked, in which the nanoparticles can be found. Even though it is a well-known fact that the blocking temperature is strongly dependent on the magnetostatic interaction, the overall effect of the dipolar interaction remains unclear. In a system of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles, placed along a linear chain, we address the effect of the dipole-dipole interaction on the blocking temperature of the system. We add disorder into the system by allowing random sizes of the particles and random directions of their uniaxial anisotropy axis. We perform numerical simulations of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, taking into account an explicit dependence of the saturation magnetization and uniaxial anisotropy energy density on temperature, relevant for systems where the blocking temperature is high. From ZFC magnetization measurements for different strengths of the dipolar coupling, we show that the blocking temperature is a non-monotonic function of the mean distance between particles. The blocking temperature reaches its maximum value when particles touch each other, then decreases as the mean distance between particles increases, and attains a minimum value, starting to increase again up to a constant value where the dipolar interaction becomes negligible."

Magnetization reversal results exhibit anisotropic behavior in both as-deposited and annealed samples. The random anisotropy model explains the change in coercivity in the transverse axis with respect to the longitudinal axis for CFB annealed at 350 °C. Broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectra reveal that the damping parameter decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Ultra-low damping of 0.004 is obtained with annealing at 350 °C.

        "abstract": "Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy-based magnetic tunnel junctions (p-MTJs) with low Gilbert damping constant (α) are of particular interest for fast and low-power consumption magnetic random-access memory (MRAM). However, obtaining a faster switching speed and lower power consumption is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a Mo-based perpendicular double free layer structure with a low Gilbert damping constant of 0.02 relative to W-based films, as measured by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect equipment. To show the influence of different film structures on the Gilbert damping constant, we measured the Mo-based single free layer. Thereafter, we deposited the full stacks with the Mo-based double free layer and obtained a high tunneling magnetoresistance of 136.3% and high thermal stability. The results of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the Mo-based films had better crystallinity, sharper interfaces, and weaker diffusion than the W-based films and thus produced a weaker external contribution of the Gilbert damping constant. As a result of the weak spin-orbit coupling in the Mo-based structure, the intrinsic contribution of the Gilbert damping constant was also weak, thereby leading to the small Gilbert damping constant of the Mo-based stacks. In addition, the macro-spin simulation results demonstrated that the magnetization switching by the spin transfer torque of the Mo-based MTJs was faster than that of the W-based MTJs. These findings help to understand the mechanism behind the good performance of Mo-based p-MTJ films and show the great promise of these structures in low-power consumption MRAM or other spintronic devices."

XRD pattern revealed the B2 type atomic ordering with a crystallite size of approximately $$21$$ 21 nm. Morphological properties were investigated using SEM which revealed the formation of uniform nanoparticle flakes. Nearly perfect stoichiometry was obtained in EDS elemental mapping. The ferromagnetic properties were investigated by static magnetic measurements conducted by vibrating sample magnetometry. The dynamic magnetic response was measured from Vector Network Analyzer ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) technique in a broad range of microwave frequencies (5–20 GHz). A broad FMR linewidth was obtained from the FMR experiment due to the presence of magnetic inhomogeneities in the bulk sample. The Gilbert damping parameter which describes the magnetization relaxation was obtained from the fitting of FMR data with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We obtained the lowest value of the Gilbert damping for the sample annealed at 900 °C temperature for 4 h.

Blocking temperature is a remarkable quantity that allows one to determine the regime, superparamagnetic or blocked, in which the nanoparticles can be found. Even though it is a well-known fact that the blocking temperature is strongly dependent on the magnetostatic interaction, the overall effect of the dipolar interaction remains unclear. In a system of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles, placed along a linear chain, we address the effect of the dipole-dipole interaction on the blocking temperature of the system. We add disorder into the system by allowing random sizes of the particles and random directions of their uniaxial anisotropy axis. We perform numerical simulations of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, taking into account an explicit dependence of the saturation magnetization and uniaxial anisotropy energy density on temperature, relevant for systems where the blocking temperature is high. From ZFC magnetization measurements for different strengths of the dipolar coupling, we show that the blocking temperature is a non-monotonic function of the mean distance between particles. The blocking temperature reaches its maximum value when particles touch each other, then decreases as the mean distance between particles increases, and attains a minimum value, starting to increase again up to a constant value where the dipolar interaction becomes negligible."

The present work continues the study of magnetization steps (MSTs) from the infinite spin chains in Cd-diluted TMMC (chemical formula: $$\\mathrm {(CH_{3})_{4}NMn_{\\textit{x}}Cd_{1-\\textit{x}}Cl_{3}}$$ ( CH 3 ) 4 NMn x Cd 1 - x Cl 3 ). MSTs from a sample with x = 0.50 were studied in magnetic fields up to 17 T. These MSTs originated from chains with the following numbers of NN spins: n = 2, 4, 6 and 8. An earlier study of MSTs from samples with 0.16 $$\\le$$ ≤ x $$\\le$$ ≤ 0.50 was carried out at T = 0.55 K. In that earlier lower-resolution study, the observed MSTs were from chains with n = 2 and 4. The 0.55 K data seemed to agree with the isotropic NN Heisenberg (INNH) model, which includes only the NN Heisenberg exchange and the Zeeman energy. The present higher-resolution data at 20 mK show clear discrepancies with this model, indicating that some weak interactions that are not included in the INNH model are not insignificant. Discrepancies with the INNH model in magnetic fields B $$\\approx$$ ≈ 1 T are attributed to the dipole-dipole anisotropy. Of greater significance are discrepancies in the ratios of the magnetic field at different MSTs. These discrepancies are observed above 2 T. The discrepancies in the field ratios imply that the energies of the short spin chains deviate from those calculated from the INNH model. Similar deviations were noted a few earlier studies of spin clusters in other materials. In these earlier studies the deviations were attributed to biquadratic exchange. Although the known properties of Cd-diluted TMMC are consistent with the requirements for a significant biquadratic exchange, the present data are insufficient for concluding that biquadratic exchange is definitively the cause of the observed discrepancies in the field ratios."

Sol-gel route was used for the fabrication of Sr_0.6 Zn_0.4 Gd_x Fe_2- x O_4 (0.00, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075, 0.100) ferrites. The structural, magnetic, microwave, and DC (direct current) properties of prepared Nps were found using of number characterization techniques. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Sr_0.6 Zn_0.4 Gd_ x Fe_2- x O_4 SFs showed a single cubic phase. The magnetic behavior was determined by applying a field of 2 kOe. The various magnetic features, including those determined based on the M-H loop, and prepared spinel ferrites showed the soft nature of magnetic materials. When amount of gadolinium (Gd) is increased, then saturation magnetization, coercivity, remanence magnetization is decreased. The Ms values decreased from 69.36 to 32.18 emu/g, coercivity reduced from 220 to 14 emu/g, and remanence magnetization is decreased from 32 to 3 emu/g. The electrical parameters revealed that direct current resistivity and activation energy (Ea) increased (from 0.16 eV to 0.28eV) with the inclusion of the Gd. The activation energy was increased from 0.16 to 0.28 eV. The dielectric constant and loss of permittivity and permeability were determined by applying the frequency 5.5–9.5 GHz. From the above enhanced parameters, it can be concluded that fabricated SFs may be suitable for high-frequency devices."

        "abstract": "We present our findings on how orange peel coupling (OPC) between the ferromagnetic layers affects spin transfer torque-assisted magnetization reversal dynamics in CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO pentalayer nanopillar devices. We accomplish this by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation (dynamical equation) using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order numerical technique. To begin, we examine the influence of OPC on switching times by simulating the LLGS equation separately for each pentalayer device, both with and without OPC. The magnetization switching times for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices in the absence of OPC are 58 ps , 82 ps , and 154 ps , respectively. When introducing OPC in the pentalayer alloys, we observe a reduction in switching times of 3.5%, 11%, and 40% for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices, respectively. Furthermore, we calculate the current density required to reverse the magnetization of the free layer in CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO pentalayer devices, which is found to be $$0.78\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 0.78 × 10 12 A / m 2 , $$1.8\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 1.8 × 10 12 A / m 2 , and $$4.4\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 4.4 × 10 12 A / m 2 , respectively. In addition, we investigate how the thicknesses of the free and spacer layers, as well as the wavelength and amplitude of interface roughness, affect the magnetization switching time. Understanding the effects of OPC paves the way for the practical implementation of spin transfer torque (STT)-based memory devices."

The hysteresis loop area, remanent magnetization, and coercive field values of the permalloy disk have been obtained as functions of the frequency and amplitude of the external sinusoidal magnetic field. In accordance with the simulation results obtained, a transition from a dynamically disordered phase to a dynamically ordered phase has been observed after a certain frequency value, and the phase transition region moved towards higher frequency values with increasing field amplitude. The triggered dynamical orders in other directions than the field have been observed for different frequency intervals. According to the shape effect of soft magnetic material, permalloy disk on dynamic behavior has been slowly reflected when the shape is concave."

Currently, the research on the properties of MRGs mostly depends on experimental characterization, and the theoretical analysis and model description are still lacking. In this work, a new model was established to describe the shear stress of MRGs. Different from the traditional chain models for magnetorheological materials, the proposed model can take into account not only the interactions within the chain but also the interactions with other chains. The contributions of particles and carriers to shear stress under different fields were also analyzed. A new description for the magnetization of MRGs was proposed and compared with the Frohlich-Kennelly equation. The calculated results of the proposed model were compared with experiment and it is found that both are in good agreement. This work can better predict the rheological properties of MRGs under different conditions and is also useful for the design of magnetorheological devices.

In our analysis on the FAD point, we introduce a Gibbs sampler of the ground states at zero temperature, and we exploit it in two different ways: first, we perform via perfect sampling an empirical evaluation of the spontaneous magnetization at zero temperature, finding a non-zero value in $$d=3$$ d = 3 and a vanishing value in $$d=2$$ d = 2 . Second, using a careful coupling with the Bernoulli site percolation model in $$d=2$$ d = 2 , we prove rigorously that under imposing $$+$$ + boundary conditions, the magnetization in the center of a square box tends to zero in the thermodynamical limit and the two-point correlations decay exponentially. Also, using again a coupling argument, we show that there exists a unique zero-temperature infinite-volume Gibbs measure for the BEG. In our analysis of the AD line we restrict ourselves to $$d=2$$ d = 2 and, by comparing the BEG model with a Bernoulli site percolation in a matching graph of $${\\mathbb {Z}}^2$$ Z 2 , we get a condition for the vanishing of the infinite-volume limit magnetization improving, for low temperatures, earlier results obtained via expansion techniques."

The polycrystalline sample was synthesized through the solid-state reaction method. The as-prepared sample was analyzed using XRD, and the Rietveld refinement of the X-ray pattern suggested a single-phase crystalline sample with an orthorhombic structure that crystallizes in O′ symmetry ( a  ≥  c  ≥  b /√2). The refined lattice parameters were determined to be a  = 5.5160(6) Å, b  = 7.7587(8) Å, c  = 5.4903(5) Å. The FESEM results showed the shapes and sizes of the as-prepared sample, while the EDAX spectra confirmed the elements present in the sample. Magnetic measurements indicated a relaxation mechanism in the sample, with the reversibility point of the ZFC and FC curves decreasing with increasing applied field, at 177 K, 166 K, and 131 K. This suggests that the magnetic relaxation of moments is dependent on the applied magnetic field, and the derivative d ( M _ FC  −  M _ ZFC )/ dT indicates the magnetic relaxation. The inverse magnetic susceptibility curve χ^−1 (T) plot gave the paramagnetic Curie temperature at ~ 264 K. The M-H curves indicated the transition from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase.

        "abstract": "Objective The potential of magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the detection and evolution of new multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions was analyzed. Methods Nineteen patients with MS obtained conventional MRI, MTI, and DTI examinations bimonthly for 12 months and again after 24 months at 1.5 T MRI. MTI was acquired with balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) in 10 min (1.3 mm^3 isotropic resolution) yielding both magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) parameters (pool size ratio (F), exchange rate (kf), and relaxation times (T1/T2)). DTI provided fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Results At the time of their appearance on MRI, the 21 newly detected MS lesions showed significantly reduced MTR/F/kf and prolonged T1/T2 parameters, as well as significantly reduced FA and increased AD/MD/RD. Significant differences were already observed for MTR 4 months and for qMT parameters 2 months prior to lesions’ detection on MRI. DTI did not show any significant pre-lesional differences. Slightly reversed trends were observed for most lesions up to 8 months after their detection for qMT and less pronounced for MTR and three diffusion parameters, while appearing unchanged on MRI. Conclusions MTI provides more information than DTI in MS lesions and detects tissue changes 2 to 4 months prior to their appearance on MRI. After lesions’ detection, qMT parameter changes promise to be more sensitive than MTR for the lesions’ evolutional assessment. Overall, bSSFP-based MTI adumbrates to be more sensitive than MRI and DTI for the early detection and follow-up assessment of MS lesions. Clinical relevance statement When additionally acquired in routine MRI, fast bSSFP-based MTI can complement the MRI/DTI longitudinal lesion assessment by detecting MS lesions 2–4 months earlier than with MRI, which could implicate earlier clinical decisions and better follow-up/treatment assessment in MS patients. Key Points • Magnetization transfer imaging provides more information than DTI in multiple sclerosis lesions and can detect tissue changes 2 to 4 months prior to their appearance on MRI. • After lesions’ detection, quantitative magnetization transfer changes are more pronounced than magnetization transfer ratio changes and therefore promise to be more sensitive for the lesions’ evolutional assessment. • Balanced steady-state free precession–based magnetization transfer imaging is more sensitive than MRI and DTI for the early detection and follow-up assessment of multiple sclerosis lesions."

The ferromagnetic properties were investigated by static magnetic measurements conducted by vibrating sample magnetometry. The dynamic magnetic response was measured from Vector Network Analyzer ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR) technique in a broad range of microwave frequencies (5–20 GHz). A broad FMR linewidth was obtained from the FMR experiment due to the presence of magnetic inhomogeneities in the bulk sample. The Gilbert damping parameter which describes the magnetization relaxation was obtained from the fitting of FMR data with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We obtained the lowest value of the Gilbert damping for the sample annealed at 900 °C temperature for 4 h.

The effects of changing neighboring interaction and uniaxial crystal field anisotropy parameters on the obtained soliton and its amplitudes are explored. The changing values of neighboring interaction parameters are exhibited as an increase in wave height with increasing parametric values, but increasing the values of the uniaxial crystal field anisotropy parameter causes a reduction in wave height.

By applying a 7.2 kV cm^−1 electric field, the coexistence of uniaxial and fourfold in-plane magnetic anisotropy is observed in 45° Sample, while a typical uniaxial anisotropy is found in 0° Sample. Abstract Manipulating strain mode and degree that can be applied to epitaxial complex oxide thin films have been a cornerstone of strain engineering. In recent years, lift-off and transfer technology of the epitaxial oxide thin films have been developed that enabled the integration of heterostructures without the limitation of material types and crystal orientations. Moreover, twisted integration would provide a more interesting strategy in artificial magnetoelectric heterostructures. A specific twist angle between the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic oxide layers corresponds to the distinct strain regulation modes in the magnetoelectric coupling process, which could provide some insight in to the physical phenomena. In this work, the La_0.67Sr_0.33MnO_3 (001)/0.7Pb(Mg_1/3Nb_2/3)O_3–0.3PbTiO_3 (011) (LSMO/PMN-PT) heterostructures with 45º and 0º twist angles were assembled via water-etching and transfer process.

The fitting of the ferromagnetic resonance field reveals that the strain coupling generated by the 45° twist angle causes different lattice distortion of LSMO, thereby enhancing both the fourfold and uniaxial anisotropy.

The successful formation of BHF and BT was confirmed through Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, revealing distinct absorption peaks indicative of the tetragonal configuration of BT and the BHF’s crystal structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) depicted the unique morphologies and dispersions of particles in the synthesized nanocomposites, with BHF appearing larger (~ 82 nm) than BT (~ 50 nm). Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) findings exhibited an increased resistance to demagnetization with the addition of BT, despite a slight decline at 75% BT concentration due to the non-magnetic nature of BT dominating. Uniquely, the study presented an in-depth analysis of the composites’ conductivity, detailing their non-monotonic behavior across a frequency range. A detailed investigation into the complex permittivity and permeability revealed the composite’s enhanced ability to store and dissipate both electrical and magnetic energy, a function influenced by the concentrations of BT and BHF. A pivotal highlight of this research was the significant achievement of a reflection loss (RL) value of − 45 dB at 9.3 GHz for the composite with 75% BHF, suggesting the composite’s potential as an effective microwave absorber. This study represents a significant step toward designing and optimizing nanocomposites for specific applications in the realm of electromagnetic materials."

Optical properties were determined by visible light absorption between 200 and 500 nm in the UV–Vis broad reflectance spectrum.

Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of Ni_1- x Zn_ x Fe_2O_4 nanopowders with different compositions were investigated in order to establish the nature of the temperature dependences ( T  = 3.7–300 K) of the spin moment of each sublattice and total spin moment. The temperature ranges in which this reorientation is observed depends on the zinc content in the compositions. A standard material of coal tar pyrolyze was used as ethalon for the calculation of the spin concentrations. It is shown that the causes of temperature changes in spin concentrations of different sublattices and, consequently, the reorientation of the total spin moment are as follows: the existence of fractions of massive grains in the Ni_1-xZn_xFe_2O_4 nanopowders characterized by an ultrafine structure, a finely dispersed doublet, and intermediate — superparamagnetism and nonstoichiometry, as well as in canted and superparamagnetic states."

Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses reveal nonuniform grain distribution, with an average grain size of approximately 2.12 µm. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms that the Sr_2FeMnO_6 crystallised as a double-perovskite structure with a cubic cell belonging to Fm3m (225) symmetry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Fe 2p and Mn 2p core levels confirm the mixed chemical ionic states of Fe (Fe^3+ and Fe^4+) and Mn (Mn^3+ and Mn^4+) in the Sr_2FeMnO_6 system. O 1 s XPS spectra reveal oxygen existing in the form of lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancies while Sr is presented as Sr^2+. The Raman phonon modes confirm phase purity and Fe/MnO_6 octahedral vibration of the system. The Sr_2FeMnO_6 system exhibits a ferrimagnetic nature with a remnant magnetisation value of approximately 0.11 µB/f.u. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals a heat-flow peak temperature of 862.1 °C, which possibly corresponds to a magnetic transition temperature. Finally, the temperature-dependent dielectric constant confirms the existence of a ferroelectric–paraelectric transition at 528 K. Dielectric relaxation behaviour, with an activation energy of approximately 1.93 eV, is observed and is caused by the thermal motion of double ionised oxygen vacancies."

Hydrogenation was found not to change the Curie point of the compound Dy_2Fe_10Al_7, but at the same time it affects remarkably the temperature of the magnetic compensation transition. The coercive force increases upon hydrogenation, and thus the magnetocrystalline anisotropy can be concluded to increase due to changes in the local environment of the dysprosium ion caused by insertion of hydrogen atoms into the crystal lattice. The relative volume change Δ V / V of the unit cell of the hydride Dy_2Fe_10Al_7H_3.2 was shown to be 3%. The investigation of the peculiarities of the structural state allowed concluding that hydrogenation causes significant modification of the microstructure, which in turn changes the physical and functional properties of the hydrogenated materials."

Here, it should be noted that the most common experimental method to determine $$\\alpha $$ is the ferromagnetic resonance. The previous study on the ferrimagnetic resonance (FiMR) concluded that the effective Gilbert damping parameter $${\\alpha }_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$ significantly increases as the temperature approaches $${T}_{\\mathrm{A}}$$ and diverges at $${T}_{\\mathrm{A}}$$ . However, a recent theoretical study has provided a new perspective on $$\\alpha $$ of ferrimagnets; the temperature dependence of FiMR is attributed to that of magnetic dynamics, not to that of $$\\alpha $$ . This chapter presents a macroscopic theory and experimental results on FiMR, providing an additional evidence of temperature-insensitive $$\\alpha $$ of ferrimagnets. The theory, which considers both the antiferromagnetic-like and ferromagnetic-like dynamics, can describe FiMR in a wide temperature range across $${T}_{\\mathrm{A}}$$ without divergence of $$\\alpha $$ .

Among these materials, the strontium ferromolybdate Sr_2FeMoO_6– δ (SFMO) has been relatively less known compared to cobaltites and manganites despite its 100% spin polarization of the conduction electrons and a high Curie temperature. In the present chapter, a stable fabrication technology and a systematic analysis of nanocomposites consisting of SFMO grains with SrMoO_4 (SMO) dielectric shells are presented. SFMO-SMO nanocomposites were fabricated as follows: synthesis of the SFMO single-phase nanopowders by a modified citrate-gel technique; compaction under high pressure; thermal treatment for the formation of dielectric shells on the grain surface. The nanocomposite exhibits a transitional behavior of the conductivity type from metallic, which is characteristic of the SFMO, to semiconducting in the temperature range from 4 to 300 K in applied magnetic fields up to 10 T. A negative MR is observed due to the tunneling of spin-polarized charge carriers through dielectric interlayers. The MR value reaches 43% in a field of 8 Т at 10 K. The dielectric shell thickness was determined to be about 10 nm from the electrical breakdown voltage on the current-voltage characteristics. The observed electrical breakdown is found to be a reversible process determined by the impact ionization of atoms in the dielectric in strong electric fields depending on the electrons knocked-out from SrMoO_4. It was found that the MR changes the sign from negative to positive in the electrical breakdown region, revealing giant MR properties."

The used mathematical models in the research of the three-dimensional electromagnetic field of the induction system allow to apply analytical calculation methods. There are no restrictions on the thickness and width of the metal strip or the frequency of the field. The current load is modeled using conductors in the form of a current layer. The analytical method is based on a two-dimensional integral transformation of the magnetic field and current load. The analytical solution, taking into account the velocity of the conducting medium, is found for the magnetic field in the area of the metal strip and the area without eddy currents. Calculations are made for the current density in the area of the moving strip. In addition to the distribution of the electromagnetic field and current density, specific expressions are obtained for energy and force characteristics. An analysis of the attractive forces of ferromagnetic strips to the magnetic core of the single-phase inductor is conducted. It is established that the electrodynamic stabilization of the strip position in the center of the air gap is achieved in the range of intermediate frequencies (400–800 Hz), depending on the magnitude of the voltage (current) supplied to the inductor.

The resistivity measurements show that it is a semiconductor characterized roughly by a ln(1/ T ) temperature dependence in wide temperature region without trace of superconductivity. Magnetization measurements show that it has a general ferromagnetic signal with a weak superparamagnetic background. Many grains of the sample show clear interactions with a NbFeB magnet. The detected Cu concentration is much lower than the expected nominal one.

        "abstract": "The magnetic properties of a ferrimagnetic-type bathroom-tile (4–8) core–shell nanostructure with the mixed spins (3/2, 7/2) are studied using Monte Carlo simulations. The aim of this paper is to study the impact of the core size on the magnetic properties of a core–shell nanosystem. We start by illustrating and discussing the ground-state phase diagrams in different physical parameter planes. Then, we study the thermal behavior of magnetizations and susceptibilities. Furthermore, we examine the core size effect on the compensation temperature. Finally, we discuss the variation of the total magnetization as a function of the crystal and external magnetic fields."

        "abstract": "The Blume-Capel Ising model has been investigated in the framework of developed mean field theory for a decorated ferrimagnet of two interprenetrating lattices. Based on certain variations of the spin crystal fields, novel features of long-range orders have been obtained in this research paper. Particularly, for a decorated square lattice consisting of spin-3/2 and decorating spin-5/2 ions on the bonds, characteristic results have been obtained. For the present system, many ferrimagnetic compensation temperatures were induced. It is worth to note that the contribution of the total magnetization to the superparamagnetism phenomenon production of a decorated mixed spin ferrimagnet with $$J_{1} = - 0.5$$ J 1 = - 0.5 , $$J_{2} = - 1.0$$ J 2 = - 1.0 , has been indicated as well. So, characteristic total magnetization behaviors in the $$(M,D_{B} /\\left| {J_{2} } \\right|)$$ ( M , D B / J 2 ) space have not previously been considered."

We used the double-time temperature-dependent Green’s function technique within the random phase approximation. Mn_2NiZ has the Hg_2CuTi-type structure consisting of four interpenetrating face centered cubic sub-lattices. Mn_2NiZ exhibits a ferrimagnetic order due to antiparallel alignment between the Mn atoms and a behavior with completely compensated ferrimagnetism at temperatures close to the critical temperature. In the case of no external magnetic field, N-type ferrimagnetic behavior of Neél is observed. When the system is subject to an external magnetic field, the magnetization curves as a function of temperature exhibit quite interesting behaviors, and one observes the first-order phase transitions where the magnetization jumps. Indeed, we observed the magnetization plateau in the field dependence of the total magnetization at low temperatures."

A standard material of coal tar pyrolyze was used as ethalon for the calculation of the spin concentrations. It is shown that the causes of temperature changes in spin concentrations of different sublattices and, consequently, the reorientation of the total spin moment are as follows: the existence of fractions of massive grains in the Ni_1-xZn_xFe_2O_4 nanopowders characterized by an ultrafine structure, a finely dispersed doublet, and intermediate — superparamagnetism and nonstoichiometry, as well as in canted and superparamagnetic states."

The widespread use of CFN led to significantly increased exposure to people and the environment to these nanoparticles. Until now, there is not any published paper describing the adverse effect of repeated oral intake of this nanoformulation on rats’ lungs. So, the current research aims to elucidate the pulmonary toxicity prompted by different concentrations of CFN in rats as well as to explore the mechanistic way of such toxicity. We used 28 rats that were divided equally into 4 groups. The control group received normal saline, and the experimental groups received CFN at dosage levels 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/kg bwt. Our findings revealed that CFN enhanced dose-dependent oxidative stress manifested by raising in the MDA levels and declining in the GSH content. The histopathological examination revealed interstitial pulmonary inflammation along with bronchial and alveolar damage in both 0.5 and 5 mg CFN given groups. All these lesions were confirmed by the immunohistochemical staining that demonstrated strong iNOS and Cox-2 protein expression. There was also a significant upregulation of TNF α , Cox-2, and IL-1 β genes with downregulation of IL-10 and TGF- β genes. Additionally, the group receiving 0.05 mg CFN did not exhibit any considerable toxicity in all measurable parameters. We concluded that the daily oral intake of either 0.5 or 5 mg CFN, but not 0.05 mg, could induce pulmonary toxicity via NPs and/or its leached components (cobalt and iron)-mediated oxido-inflammatory stress. Our findings may help to clarify the mechanisms of pulmonary toxicity generated by these nanoparticles through outlining the standards for risk assessment in rats as a human model."

        "abstract": "Despite being essential in determining absolute paleomagnetic field intensity (API) with high fidelity over Earth science research topics, API determination still suffers little quantitative success. This is due to common nonideal magnetic behaviors in experiments using natural rocks caused by physiochemical changes in the magnetic minerals contained. Although linking rock-magnetic parameters to API results may be fundamental, negligible effort has been made using the Tsunakawa–Shaw (TS) API method despite its potentially high experimental success rate in overcoming nonideal magnetic effects. Here, we explore the relationships between rock-magnetic parameters retrieved using relatively rapid and widely pre-conducted measurements and TS API results from late Cenozoic basaltic rocks. We selected rock-magnetic parameters quantified from strong-field high-temperature thermomagnetic curves, magnetic hysteresis loops, and back-field isothermal remanent magnetization demagnetizations. We provide new data pairs of rock-magnetic parameters and TS API results for 41 basaltic rock samples from 8 sites (cooling units) in Northeast China. Then, by compiling them with published data of similar quality, we compiled 133 pairs of rock-magnetic and TS API data at the sample level (38 sites). Using this data compilation, the following topics of interest were identified: Magnetic coercivity (B_c) and remanence coercivity (B_cr) among the hysteresis parameters, and the thermomagnetic parameter ITC_|m| (an index of thermal change quantifying an average of the differences in saturation magnetization at a full temperature range of during a single heating–cooling run) allow meaningful and efficient discrimination between data subsets divided by “success” or “failure” in the API results. We propose sample preselection criteria for the TS experiment: a minimal set of B_c ≥ 13 mT (or B_cr ≥ 26 mT) and ITC_|m|≤ 0.15. Moreover, extended consideration based on the preselection criteria may allow the screening of potentially biased specimen/sample-level API estimates in the site-averaged determination of such a site with a large within-site API dispersion.

        "abstract": "This study presented a facile synthesis route via the precipitation method for the production of magnetic biochar from oil palm frond (OPF). The physicochemical characteristics including surface, functional, and magnetic properties of the synthesized magnetic biochar revealed that the surface morphology, porosity, and magnetic properties enhanced its adsorption capacity for the removal of crystal violet (CV) and sunset yellow (SY) from aqueous solution. The saturation magnetization of OPF biochar was found to be 8.41 emu/g, coercivity (Hc) of 83.106 G, and retentivity (Mr) of 1.475 emu/g which implies that OPF magnetic biochar can be facilely separated from aqueous solution. The result also demonstrated superparamagnetic properties which provided suitable magnetic responsive characteristics to an external magnetic field. The interactive effect of the operational conditions of pH, adsorbent dosage, initial concentration, and temperature was investigated in a batch adsorption study using the central composite design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM). It was indicated that an increase in adsorbent dosage to 1.0 g/L at a lower initial concentration (50 ppm) conducted at 20 °C favoured optimum removal of CV and SY at pH 11 and 4, respectively. The Langmuir isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacity ( $$q_{\\max }$$ q max ) of 149.03 and 342.47 mg/g was achieved for CV and SY dyes, respectively. The kinetic data proved to be best fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters revealed spontaneous and endothermic reactions. The suitability and sustainability of the magnetic biochar were enhanced by its regeneration potential for effective adsorption of CV and SY after 5 cycles which indicates its outstanding reusability. Hence, OPF magnetic biochar exhibited prospective application for the removal of dyes from wastewater."

This strategy allows for the separation and preconcentration of the water-borne pathogen from high-volume samples, up to 1000 mL. The limit of detection of the electrochemical immunosensor resulted in 100 CFU mL^−1 and improved up to 0.1 CFU mL^−1 when the preconcentration strategy was applied in 1 L of sample (10^3-fold improvement). Remarkably, the immunosensor achieves the limit of detection in less than 2.5 h and simplified the analytical procedure. This represents the lowest concentration reported to date for electrochemical immunosensing of Legionella cells without the need for pre-enrichment or DNA amplification. Furthermore, the study successfully demonstrates the extraction of bacteria retained on different filtering materials using immunomagnetic separation, highlighting the high efficiency of the magnetic particles to pull out the bacteria directly from solid materials. This promising feature expands the applicability of the method beyond water systems for detecting bacteria retained in air filters of air conditioning units by directly performing the immunomagnetic separation in the filters.

Phase examination of by XRD indicated that the doping of x  = 0.25 ratio nano-sized SnO_2 to the strontium sites improved the formation of the Bi-2212 high-temperature superconducting phase. SEM micrographs showed that the morphological structure of all samples consisted of plate-like grains, which were separated from each other by grain boundaries, indicating the Bi-2212 superconducting phase.

No current densities enter the description in this formulation, but the particle density is split into different spin components.

These include, but are not limited to, wastewater management, soil remediation and groundwater treatment, removal of contaminants from water or soil, magnetic separation techniques, controlled and site-specific drug delivery, and biomedical diagnostic procedures. This research focuses on the dynamic behaviour of a conducting dusty fluid, modelled using the Casson framework, in the presence of a thermally active plate with ramped movement and the effects of a magnetic field. The model also incorporates several key physical phenomena, including thermal radiation, heat generation, and Newtonian heating wall conditions. To describe the time-dependent flow behaviour mathematically, partial differential equations are employed. Analytical solutions are derived using mathematical approach, notably the Laplace transform (LT). The results, including changes in flow profiles and various physical quantities due to various influencing factors, are depicted through graphs and tables, offering a clear visual representation of the findings. The research concludes that a higher thermal relaxation time parameter significantly improves thermal characteristics. Higher levels of particle concentration parameter correspond to slower fluid flow. Both the heat transfer rate and shearing stress on the plate exhibit temporal variations for a range of physical parameters. The particle concentration parameter has a notable impact on thermal transmission. The study’s findings may be applied in climate modelling, weather prediction, contaminant transport, and studying phenomena such as dust storms, air pollution, and dispersion of volcanic ash clouds."

The obtained low-cost BRM/BTiO_2 composites exhibit remarkable photocatalytic degradation toward rhodamine B (91.2%) and tetracycline (83.6%) under visible light irradiation, much better than pristine TiO_2.

Moreover, the desired magnetic separation of BRM/BTiO_2 composites realizes the recycle and recovery of photocatalysts, favoring practical applications in environment. This work provides a cost-efficiency way to prepare RM-supported TiO_2 composites for treating organic pollutants in the wastewater, which is of great significance to the comprehensive utilization of RM waste, the cost saving of the photocatalyst, and the visible-light active enhancement of TiO_2."

The average size of all crystallites was evaluated to be 38 nm. Uniformity in the size of the particles was detected with some agglomeration. The calculated energy band gap (1.88 eV) reveals the semiconducting nature of the prepared material. The low coercivity value (103 Oe) reveals that the synthesized material is a soft ferrite. The prepared sample of nanoferrite material was found to be suitable enough for high-frequency applications."

Magnetic measurements show that nanopowders have hysteresis behavior without saturation due to their paramagnetic nature, whereas the sintered sample shows highly paramagnetic behavior.

This type of phenomenon is rare in materials and so the coupling of these properties is useful to change the magnetic ordering of materials by applying electric field and to change the electric polarization of materials by applying magnetic field. These are novel materials of having a variety of applications such as microwave components, energy harvesters, photovoltaics, data storage devices. In this paper, we made a study on two different methods of synthesis of titanium dioxide-silver ferrite nanocomposite. The characterization reveals that the hybrid nanocomposite particles of sizes less than 100 nm with homogeneous silver ferrite distribution on nanoTiO_2 and also coexistence of orthorhombic silver ferrite on tetragonal rutileTiO_2 in both synthetic approaches. The band gaps of this nanocomposites are evaluated by UV–visible spectroscopy while the magnetic properties are from VSM. Results shows there is decrease in the band gap, ferroelectric, and ferromagnetic behaviors. Hence, the synthesized TiO_2-AgFeO_2 nanocomposite is multiferroic magnetoelectric material. Therefore, it may be a promising candidate for photo catalysis, photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and nanoscale magnetic storage devices."

        "abstract": "An air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC) was implemented to examine the cathode material: bismuth ferrite (BFO) nanoparticles mixed with carbon soot. The physicochemical characterization of prepared carbon soot showed that the carbon soot particles were porous and graphitic consisting of 88% carbon. The physicochemical characterization of BFO confirms that the nanoparticles are spherical, have a high surface area, and are electrochemically active. Based on the results of the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) examination, the large surface area of BFO has been accounted for by high ORR (oxidation–reduction reaction) activities. The increasing loading rates of BFO (0.25–1 mg/cm^2) showed increasing power output, with 1 mg/cm^2 achieving the maximum power density and current density (11.99 W/m^3 and 35.45 A/m^3, respectively), which were comparable to the power output of platinum. According to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, BFO showed the lowest resistance ( R _ct) across each electrode transmission (39.5) at a loading rate of 1 mg/cm^2. This low R _ct value indicates that the cathode catalyst facilitates high electron transfer, thereby increasing the cathode's ORR activity. The cathode biofouling analysis for different concentrations of BFO conducted via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that 1.0 mg/cm^2 BFO showed the least biofouling. The results of the research suggest that BFO-blended carbon soot has potential as a cost-effective alternative for field-scale usage."

Steel materials play a crucial role in our everyday lives, and their mechanical properties and reliability are determined by their microstructure, which is influenced by heat treatment and processing. It is essential to ensure the quality of steel, as problems can arise if the microstructure and mechanical properties are not adequately assessed before shipping. To accomplish this, the study involved preparing four different steel specimens with varying material properties and heating conditions, which were then photographed using a digital camera. The proposed CNN model was tested and validated to accurately classify the ferrite substances, and it was found that even a simple CNN structure could achieve high accuracy in image classification. The implementation of this system will alleviate the burden of human visual inspection.

We accomplish this by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation (dynamical equation) using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order numerical technique. To begin, we examine the influence of OPC on switching times by simulating the LLGS equation separately for each pentalayer device, both with and without OPC. The magnetization switching times for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices in the absence of OPC are 58 ps , 82 ps , and 154 ps , respectively. When introducing OPC in the pentalayer alloys, we observe a reduction in switching times of 3.5%, 11%, and 40% for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices, respectively. Furthermore, we calculate the current density required to reverse the magnetization of the free layer in CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO pentalayer devices, which is found to be $$0.78\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 0.78 × 10 12 A / m 2 , $$1.8\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 1.8 × 10 12 A / m 2 , and $$4.4\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 4.4 × 10 12 A / m 2 , respectively. In addition, we investigate how the thicknesses of the free and spacer layers, as well as the wavelength and amplitude of interface roughness, affect the magnetization switching time.

Adding alloying elements is an effective method to further enhance these properties.

This work analyzed the microstructure, magnetization, hardness, and corrosion properties of Fe_81Ga_19− x Z_ x ( X  = 5 at.% of Ni, Mn, or Ti, and 2 at.% Al; separately) alloys. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope-electron (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Vickers hardness (HV), and a potentiostat were used for characterization.

X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the spinel crystals had a crystallite size of 19–61 nm. An increase from 25 emu/g to 52 emu/g in saturation Ms and an increase from 19 to 219 Oe in coercivity were observed, when the amount of spinel increases in the nanocomposite. The dielectric characteristics were frequency-dependent at lower frequencies, but frequency-invariant at higher frequencies. The electrical and networking industries are increasingly reliant on high-frequency ferrite nanocomposites, which are produced using ferrite and a polyaniline binder. In the present study, polyaniline is prepared by in-situ, while the ferrite is synthesized by adopting sol-gel process. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that all the samples (except PANI) possessed spinel structure. When spinel ferrite is blended with the polymer matrix, the crystallite size increased from 19 nm to 61 nm. Combining polyaniline with ferrites leads to a decreasing trend in the dielectric parameters (ε‘, ε“). Hysteresis loop analysis was conducted to evaluate the materials’ ferromagnetic properties. The saturation magnetization (Ms), remanent magnetization (Mr), and coercivity (Hc) all increased as the concentration of ferrite has been increased. The direct current (dc) resistivity and activation energy of a sample containing ferrites and polyaniline also increased. These all parameters suggested that FP-4 may be suitable for high-frequency applications. Graphical Abstract It illustrates that the dc resistivity of all samples are directly related to temperature, as heat causes charge carriers to move more. At room temperature, ferrites conduct electricity due to defects, but at a certain temperature, their primary mode of conductance is polaron hopping. The Verwey’s hypothesis explains that ferrites conduct electricity because electrons hop from one ion of the identical element to another that is randomly distributed across several crystalline lattice sites and has a different valence electron configuration."

As the magnetization region reaches an opposite electrode, the layer as a whole is tightened to the cylinder axis. In this case, the magnetization wavefront in the surface layer moves with velocity c . The analysis performed made it possible to construct a model explaining the formation of a narrowly directed short pulse of coherent electromagnetic radiation in the prebreakdown discharge stage over the surface of solid dielectric with high magnetic permeability µ. The model is based on the excitation of short-term magnetization of the ferrite surface in forming a field in the interelectrode gap and subsequent coherent addition of elementary waves forming resulting radiation."

The domain walls exhibit two kinds of reversal modes, namely vortex reversal mode and transverse reversal mode. The present study is confined to the sub-50-nm-diameter cylindrical nanowires, where the transverse domain wall is a stable configuration. The microwave properties are highly dependent on demagnetizing fields that exist along the nanowire. Two well distinguishable modes are observed in the nanowires, one that arises from the domain wall and the other due to the inhomogeneities at the edges. Both modes are found to be sensitive to the diameter of the cylindrical nanowire. The results reveal additional functionality of the DWs in cylindrical nanowires based on high-frequency spin dynamics for microwave applications."

Furthermore, the polishing characteristics and stability of the method were analyzed through rheological tests and magnetic field simulation. Orthogonal experiments were carried out on a small aspheric SiC mold using a five-axis machining center. The influence of spindle speed, polishing clearance, abrasive particle size, and other factors on material removal rate (MRR), surface morphology, surface roughness (SR), and subsurface damage (SSD) depth was explored. The results showed that MRR and SSD depth increased with spindle speed, whereas SR first decreased and then increased. Polishing clearance had a significant negative correlation effect on MRR, SR, and SSD depth, whereas abrasive particle size had a weak positive correlation effect on them. The parameter optimization method based on the multi-objective matrix was used to evaluate the influence weight of MRR, SR, and SSD depth on the orthogonal test results. The optimal scheme was determined as follows: the spindle speed was 720 rpm, the polishing gap was 0.5 mm, and the particle size was 3 μm. The verification test was carried out by using the optimal scheme. The results showed that the SR and SSD depths were considerably reduced, and the surface/subsurface quality was considerably improved.

Blocking temperature is a remarkable quantity that allows one to determine the regime, superparamagnetic or blocked, in which the nanoparticles can be found. Even though it is a well-known fact that the blocking temperature is strongly dependent on the magnetostatic interaction, the overall effect of the dipolar interaction remains unclear. In a system of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles, placed along a linear chain, we address the effect of the dipole-dipole interaction on the blocking temperature of the system. We add disorder into the system by allowing random sizes of the particles and random directions of their uniaxial anisotropy axis. We perform numerical simulations of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, taking into account an explicit dependence of the saturation magnetization and uniaxial anisotropy energy density on temperature, relevant for systems where the blocking temperature is high. From ZFC magnetization measurements for different strengths of the dipolar coupling, we show that the blocking temperature is a non-monotonic function of the mean distance between particles. The blocking temperature reaches its maximum value when particles touch each other, then decreases as the mean distance between particles increases, and attains a minimum value, starting to increase again up to a constant value where the dipolar interaction becomes negligible."

        "abstract": "We propose the Hirota bilinearization of the Fokas–Lenells derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation (FLE) with a non-vanishing background. In the proposed method, we have introduced an auxiliary function to transform the equation into bilinear form. The use of an auxiliary function makes the method simpler than the ones reported earlier. Using the proposed method we have obtained the dark (and bright) one soliton solution. We have also discussed the properties of the obtained soliton and mentioned the criteria upon which the nature of the soliton being dark or bright depends upon. Then we have obtained the dark (and bright) two soliton solution and discussed the respective properties and also through asymptotic analysis showed how the phase between the two individual solitons changes before and after interaction. Eventually we have proposed the scheme for obtaining N soliton solutions. The proposed method can be extended to other nonlinear equations where straightforward bilinearization is not feasible. Later, we have introduced a gauge transformation which transforms the spectral problem of FLE into a spectral problem for the Landau–Lifshitz (LL) spin system. Soliton act as an information carrier and LL system exhibits a variety of nonlinear structures so the study is worth doing."

Blocking temperature is a remarkable quantity that allows one to determine the regime, superparamagnetic or blocked, in which the nanoparticles can be found. Even though it is a well-known fact that the blocking temperature is strongly dependent on the magnetostatic interaction, the overall effect of the dipolar interaction remains unclear. In a system of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles, placed along a linear chain, we address the effect of the dipole-dipole interaction on the blocking temperature of the system. We add disorder into the system by allowing random sizes of the particles and random directions of their uniaxial anisotropy axis. We perform numerical simulations of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, taking into account an explicit dependence of the saturation magnetization and uniaxial anisotropy energy density on temperature, relevant for systems where the blocking temperature is high. From ZFC magnetization measurements for different strengths of the dipolar coupling, we show that the blocking temperature is a non-monotonic function of the mean distance between particles. The blocking temperature reaches its maximum value when particles touch each other, then decreases as the mean distance between particles increases, and attains a minimum value, starting to increase again up to a constant value where the dipolar interaction becomes negligible."

        "abstract": "Background Slower paces of aging are related to lower risk of developing diseases and premature death. Therefore, the greatest challenge of modern societies is to ensure that the increase in lifespan is accompanied by an increase in health span. To better understand the differences in human lifespan, new insight concerning the relationship between lifespan and the age of onset of diseases, and the ability to avoid them is needed. We aimed to comprehensively study, at a population-wide level, the sex-specific disease patterns associated with human lifespan. Methods Observational data from the SIDIAP database of a cohort of 482,058 individuals that died in Catalonia (Spain) at ages over 50 years old between the 1st of January 2006 and the 30th of June 2022 were included. The time to the onset of the first disease in multiple organ systems, the prevalence of escapers, the percentage of life free of disease, and their relationship with lifespan were evaluated considering sex-specific traits. Results In the study cohort, 50.4% of the participants were women and the mean lifespan was 83 years. The results show novel relationships between the age of onset of disease, health span, and lifespan. The key findings include: Firstly, the onset of both single and multisystem diseases is progressively delayed as lifespan increases. Secondly, the prevalence of escapers is lower in lifespans around life expectancy. Thirdly, the number of disease-free systems decreases until individuals reach lifespans around 87–88 years old, at which point it starts to increase. Furthermore, long-lived women are less susceptible to multisystem diseases. The associations between health span and lifespan are system-dependent, and disease onset and the percentage of life spent free of disease at the time of death contribute to explaining lifespan variability. Lastly, the study highlights significant system-specific disparities between women and men. Conclusions Health interventions focused on delaying aging and age-related diseases should be the most effective in increasing not only lifespan but also health span. The findings of this research highlight the relevance of Electronic Health Records in studying the aging process and open up new possibilities in age-related disease prevention that should assist primary care professionals in devising individualized care and treatment plans."

In order to satisfy the elastic boundary conditions of the spinning beam-disk containing translational and rotational stiffnesses as well as nonlinear stiffnesses, an improved version of Fourier series is employed for the admission function construction. Nonlinear dynamic behavior of the spinning beam-disk and its boundary supporting system are described based on energy principle, and the system governing equations of spinning beam-disk are formulated by the Lagrange equation of the second type. The time-domain response is then obtained by solving the system dynamic equations through Runge–Kutta method, while the reliability of the current model is verified through the comparison with those predicted by harmonic balance method. Then, the effect of sweep direction and nonlinear elastic boundary parameters on system dynamic behavior of the spinning Timoshenko beam-disk is investigated and addressed. The results show that the dynamic responses of the spinning beam-disk with nonlinear elastic boundary are sensitive to the initial values of calculation, and the nonlinear elastic boundary parameters make the spinning beam-disk exhibit complex dynamic behavior. Analysis of Poincare points in the phase diagram can better determine the dynamic behavior of spinning beam-disk, and a set of suitable nonlinear elastic boundary parameters can suppress the complex dynamic response of the spinning beam-disk."

        "abstract": "Herein, the reorientation of heavy water (D_2O) molecules adsorbed in the slit-type micropores of activated carbon fibers is investigated using the ^2H-nuclear magnetic resonance technique. The rotational correlation times ( τ _c) of D_2O are evaluated from the ^2H spin–lattice relaxation time ( T _1). The obtained τ _c values are significantly influenced by both the pore-filling ratio ( ϕ ) and temperature, thus suggesting that the adsorption of D_2O into activated carbon fibers (ACF) effectively influences the reorientation of the D_2O molecules within the ACF. The reorientational motion of D_2O is examined by the extended jump model. According to this model, the nanoconfinement effect, which results from the reduction in free volume around D_2O, is attributed to the transition-state excluded volume effect, whereas the effect of hydrogen bonding between the D_2O and surface functional groups is attributed to the transition-state hydrogen bonding effects. Furthermore, the dependence of τ _c on ϕ is explained by the chemical exchange between the pore surface adsorption sites and the central space of the pore. Thus, the dynamic behavior of adsorbed D_2O molecules reveals the mechanism of D_2O adsorption into the ACF micropores."

The present work continues the study of magnetization steps (MSTs) from the infinite spin chains in Cd-diluted TMMC (chemical formula: $$\\mathrm {(CH_{3})_{4}NMn_{\\textit{x}}Cd_{1-\\textit{x}}Cl_{3}}$$ ( CH 3 ) 4 NMn x Cd 1 - x Cl 3 ). MSTs from a sample with x = 0.50 were studied in magnetic fields up to 17 T. These MSTs originated from chains with the following numbers of NN spins: n = 2, 4, 6 and 8. An earlier study of MSTs from samples with 0.16 $$\\le$$ ≤ x $$\\le$$ ≤ 0.50 was carried out at T = 0.55 K. In that earlier lower-resolution study, the observed MSTs were from chains with n = 2 and 4. The 0.55 K data seemed to agree with the isotropic NN Heisenberg (INNH) model, which includes only the NN Heisenberg exchange and the Zeeman energy. The present higher-resolution data at 20 mK show clear discrepancies with this model, indicating that some weak interactions that are not included in the INNH model are not insignificant. Discrepancies with the INNH model in magnetic fields B $$\\approx$$ ≈ 1 T are attributed to the dipole-dipole anisotropy. Of greater significance are discrepancies in the ratios of the magnetic field at different MSTs. These discrepancies are observed above 2 T. The discrepancies in the field ratios imply that the energies of the short spin chains deviate from those calculated from the INNH model. Similar deviations were noted a few earlier studies of spin clusters in other materials. In these earlier studies the deviations were attributed to biquadratic exchange. Although the known properties of Cd-diluted TMMC are consistent with the requirements for a significant biquadratic exchange, the present data are insufficient for concluding that biquadratic exchange is definitively the cause of the observed discrepancies in the field ratios."

The dome part of a hydrogen pressure vessel is formed by a spinning process using a pipe that is manufactured by a hot forging method. For thick pipes, there is a problem with non-uniform formation of the dome part. Since this problem causes the boss part not to form, it is difficult to obtain the desired thickness of the boss part for attaching a valve, which may affect the structural safety of the dome part. In this study, a finite element analysis (FEA) model of the spinning process was established for a thick pipe, and the validity of the analysis was compared with the result of the actual process. Furthermore, the causes of forming defects during the spinning process were reviewed through FEA by applying various design parameters. Based on the results, design factors were selected to control the forming defects in the spinning process, and a spinning process was designed to minimize the thickness change of the dome part."

To verify the accuracy of the SDBC model with large rotation and demonstrate its capability to effectively consider the rotational effects such as the centrifugal stiffening and gyroscopic effects, the natural characteristics and dynamic responses of the proposed model are compared with those obtained from reported research and experimental results. Furthermore, the effects of the rotating speed, contact stiffness, and blade number on the dynamic characteristics of the SDBC system with multi-blade rubbing are investigated. The results indicate that the phase angle between the rotor deflection and the unbalance excitation force increases with the increasing rotating speed, which significantly influences the rubbing penetration of each blade. The natural frequency of the SDBC system with rubbing constrain can be observed in the acceleration response of the casing and the torsional response of the shaft, and the frequency is related to the contact stiffness. Moreover, the vibration amplitude increases significantly with the product of the blade number under rubbing, and the rotating frequency approaches the natural frequency of the SDBC system.

        "abstract": "Using the linear combination operator method and variational technique improved by Tokuda, we obtain the expression of the effective mass of a strong coupled polaron in an anisotropic quantum dot. Due to the spin–orbit interaction, the effective mass of the polaron splits into two branches. The dependence of effective mass on temperature, electron–phonon coupling strength, transverse and longitudinal confinement lengths, and velocity is discussed by numerical calculation. The theoretical results indicate that the effective mass of the polaron is an increasing function of temperature and electron–phonon coupling strength, but a decreasing function of transverse confinement length, longitudinal confinement length, and velocity. The absolute value of spin splitting effective mass increases with the increase of temperature and spin–orbit coupling parameter, but decreases with the increase of transverse confinement length, longitudinal confinement length, and velocity. Due to the heavy hole characteristic, the spin splitting effective mass is negative."

        "abstract": "Half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloys attracted much attention in the last few decades due to their significant physical properties as well as its potential applications in spintronic devices. To explore and predict the various physical properties of Co-based Heusler alloy, Co_2MnSi (CMS), First principles calculations are of interest and has been used in the present study. Optimized E–V curves represent that CMS alloy is most stable in its magnetic L2_1 structural phase. The electronic charge density plot represents the ionic bonding along with co-valent character for the compound. DOS and BS calculations shows 100% spin polarization at Fermi level (E_F) which confirms the half metallic character of the compound. DOS exhibited the prominent role of Co-3d and Mn-3d electronic states along with Si-2p electronic states. Estimated magnetic moment of Co_2MnSi Heusler alloy was found to be ~ 5μ_B per f. u. which is in line with the Slater-Pauling behaviour. Dynamical stability of Co_2MnSi Heusler alloy has also been verified by the phonon dispersion curves which revealed that compound is dynamically stable. Additionally, the physical properties have also been explored as a consequence of SOC and significant changes in electronic and optical properties were observed. The observed significant results of electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of CMS Heusler alloy makes it promising towards potential application in optical and spintronic devices."

        "abstract": "We present our findings on how orange peel coupling (OPC) between the ferromagnetic layers affects spin transfer torque-assisted magnetization reversal dynamics in CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO pentalayer nanopillar devices. We accomplish this by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation (dynamical equation) using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order numerical technique. To begin, we examine the influence of OPC on switching times by simulating the LLGS equation separately for each pentalayer device, both with and without OPC. The magnetization switching times for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices in the absence of OPC are 58 ps , 82 ps , and 154 ps , respectively. When introducing OPC in the pentalayer alloys, we observe a reduction in switching times of 3.5%, 11%, and 40% for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices, respectively. Furthermore, we calculate the current density required to reverse the magnetization of the free layer in CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO pentalayer devices, which is found to be $$0.78\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 0.78 × 10 12 A / m 2 , $$1.8\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 1.8 × 10 12 A / m 2 , and $$4.4\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 4.4 × 10 12 A / m 2 , respectively. In addition, we investigate how the thicknesses of the free and spacer layers, as well as the wavelength and amplitude of interface roughness, affect the magnetization switching time. Understanding the effects of OPC paves the way for the practical implementation of spin transfer torque (STT)-based memory devices."

        "abstract": "Distances in the conformal manifold, the space of CFTs related by marginal deformations, can be measured in terms of the Zamolodchikov metric. Part of the CFT Distance Conjecture posits that points in this manifold where part of the spectrum becomes free, called higher-spin points, can only be at infinite distance from the interior. There, an infinite tower of operators become conserved currents, and the conformal symmetry is enhanced to a higher-spin algebra. This proposal was initially motivated by the Swampland Distance Conjecture, one of pillars of the Swampland Program. In this work, we show that the conjecture can be tackled using only methods from the conformal toolkit, and without relying on the existence of a weakly-coupled gravity dual. Via conformal perturbation theory combined with properties of correlators and of the higher-spin algebra, we establish that higher-spin points are indeed at infinite distance in the conformal manifold. We make no assumptions besides the usual properties of local CFTs, such as unitarity and the existence of an energy-momentum tensor. In particular, we do not rely on a specific dimension of spacetime (although we assume d > 2), nor do we require the presence of supersymmetry."

On the other hand, MQS is a computational approach to compare the electronic density distributions in different molecular systems. In this order of ideas, the study aims to answer questions about electronic and structural differences caused by the spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling from the initial geometry [Steradians (SR) geometry] using the MQS framework. The MQS is based on the Molecular Quantum Similarity Measure (MQSM) using different positive operators such as Dirac delta and Coulomb operators to quantify the similarity between molecular systems. The paper presents tables with MQSM indices and Euclidean distances for different molecular clusters using initial geometry vs. geometry involved spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling. The scalar, spin–orbit and spin–spin relativistic coupling were incorporated using Amsterdam Density Functional code. The results show significant coupling of spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling on the similarity measures between different molecules. The manuscript suggests that understanding the relationship between spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling and quantum similarity could lead to deeper insights into electronic interactions in complex molecular systems and has potential applications in quantum mechanics and molecular physics."

        "title": "Nonlinear Theory: Guided Mode Analysis",
        "abstract": "This chapter describes the development of slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) formulations in the steady-state regime, as well as the application of the analyses to the description of the fundamental physics of the nonlinear saturation mechanism. The SVEA was originally developed for the treatment of continuous wave (CW) traveling wave tubes and has been adapted to the treatment of long-pulse, long-wavelength free-electron lasers or free-electron masers at millimeter wavelengths or longer that are driven by relatively low-energy accelerators such as pulse-line accelerators, modulators, and induction linear accelerators. These accelerators produce relatively low-energy but long-pulse electron beams that are used primarily to generate relatively long wavelengths, which are comparable to the transverse dimensions of the drift tube. As a consequence, the description of these free-electron lasers requires a guided mode analysis. The origins of the SVEA formalism date to the early development of traveling wave tubes for radar applications, where it was often referred to as a “moving window” model because it treats the co-propagation of a “beamlet” of electrons that is one wavelength long with the corresponding electromagnetic field. These tubes employed thermionic cathodes that operated in continuous mode with the corresponding injection of a low-power continuous seed. The structures used in traveling wave tubes produce a sub-luminous wave that can interact directly with the electron beam and induce axial bunching. It was realized early in the development of free-electron lasers that the ponderomotive wave in a free-electron laser resulted in a similar axial bunching mechanism, and a free-electron laser might be thought of as a variant on a traveling wave tube. The steady-state formulations used to model free-electron lasers bear many similarities to these “moving-window” models and were originally developed to treat long-wavelength free-electron lasers that employed long-pulse accelerators. It is important to remark that this formulation is based on the propagation of a single wave frequency; hence, it is applicable for narrow bandwidth interactions. As a result, a single-frequency approximation gives a good approximation to the wave-particle dynamics, and the electromagnetic field is represented using amplitude that varied slowly with position and the fast time scale was removed by averaging Maxwell’s equations; hence, the slowly-varying envelope eapproximation (SVEA). As explained in this chapter, the SVEA formalism is based upon a quasi-static assumption that postulates that particle trajectories in the presence of the radiation field are periodic and match the periodicity of the resonant wave. The resulting formalism integrates the dynamical equations for both the fields and particles in z , the direction of propagation, and represents a Lagrangian formulation of the interaction. This contrasts with the Eulerian formalism used in particle-in-cell simulation models. The distinction between the Lagrangian and Eulerian formalisms is described. The particle dynamics is treated by integration of the full three-dimensional Lorentz force equations, with no average imposed. As such, the step size for integration must resolve the orbital undulations experienced by the electrons as they traverse the wiggler. This requires the integrator to take 20–30 steps through each wiggler period and permits the simulation of the entrance and exit tapers in the wiggler and includes all harmonic components to the motion. As a result, both linear and nonlinear harmonic generations are implicitly included in the formulation (see Chap. 8). Further advantages to this approach accrue when treating short-wavelength free-electron lasers that employ radio frequency linear accelerators and long sequences of relatively short wigglers with quadrupoles located between the wigglers to provide strong focusing. This will be discussed further in Chap. 6. Comparisons with experiments using both helical and planar wigglers that validate the formulation are discussed. In particular, this includes an early SASE experiment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which used a helical wiggler at near THz frequencies and a series of MOPA experiments at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at millimeter wavelengths using a two-plane focusing planar wiggler that demonstrated an efficiency of 35% using a tapered wiggler."

Studies of the relationship between AC conductivity and permittivity in response to temperature (30–300°C) and frequency (1 kHz–2 MHz) have demonstrated the existence of negative permittivity over the whole test range. The observed negative permittivity is a result of free carriers oscillating plasmonically between 1 kHz and 2 MHz as a consequence of thermal excitation processes. The modelling of impedance data using various combinations of resistors and inductors exhibited the coil-less inductive characteristics of the samples. The inductive nature of samples indicates the possibility of designing synthesised compositions as coil-less inductors."

In addition to observational and experimental constraints on time varying couplings, we focus on probes of violation of energy conservation such as spontaneous production of photon and electron pairs and the e → eγ process. We discuss similarities and differences to the discussion of time varying fundamental constants and to the case of a light bosonic dark matter field that usually also causes oscillating effects."

The solitons are solutions which correspond to the uniform rotation of the particle. To prove the stability, we construct the Hamilton–Poisson representation of the Maxwell–Lorentz system. The construction relies on the Hamilton least action principle. The constructed structure is degenerate and admits a functional family of the Casimir invariants. This structure allows us to construct the Lyapunov function corresponding to a soliton. The function is a combination of the Hamiltonian with a suitable Casimir invariant. The function is conserved, and the soliton is its critical point. The key point of the proof is a lower bound for the Lyapunov function. This bound implies that the soliton is a strict local minimizer of the function. The bound holds if the effective moment of inertia of the particle in the Maxwell field is sufficiently large with respect to the “bar moment of inertia\"."

By using an approach based on frequency-dependent Lyapunov estimates, we show that this decay is polynomial in time. These results extend to an unbounded structure the ones obtained for bounded media in Nicaise and Pignotti (Z Angew Math Phys 71(3):76, 2020) via a quite different method based on the notion of cumulated past history and semi-group theory.

This theory is based on the Harish-Chandra formalism, which describes the relativistic dynamics of a massless spin-1 boson, like a photon. By this formalism, the Bohmian average transport velocity of the electromagnetic energy is formulated. It is proved that this velocity can be superluminal if the dielectric making the waveguide is non-absorptive and non-dispersive. This result is validated in the framework of quantum electrodynamics, demonstrating that the average velocity of the photon inside the waveguide is given by the contribution of instantaneous superluminal velocities. This theory, therefore, suggests the optimal conditions for designing the optical devices capable of locally transporting electromagnetic energy at superluminal velocities mitigating signal attenuation."

In the localized regime, the variance of logarithmic spin conductance σ ^2(ln G _ T ) shows a universal linear scaling with its average 〈ln G _ T 〉, independent of Fermi energy, temperature, and system size in both 1D and 2D cases. In 2D, the competition between disorder-enhanced density of states at the NM/FI interface and disorder-suppressed spin transport leads to a non-monotonic dependence of average spin conductance on the disorder strength. As a result, in the metallic regime, average spin conductance is enhanced by disorder, and a new linear scaling between spin conductance fluctuation rms( G _ T ) and average spin conductance G _ T is revealed which is universal at large system width. These universal scaling behaviors suggest that spin transport mediated by magnon in disordered 2D NM/FI systems belongs to a new universality class, different from that of charge conductance in 2D normal metal systems."

As a research method, the technique of the small-angle scattering of polarized neutrons in inclined geometry is used, which allows one to separate the contribution of inelastic scattering. Inelastic scattering can be obtained as the difference between the intensities when the neutron beam is polarized along and against the direction of the magnetic field. Spin-wave scattering is concentrated in a cone limited by the cutoff angle θ_C. It is shown that the square of the cutoff angle linearly depends on the magnetic field H and the energy gap Δ of nonfield nature: $$\\theta _{{\\text{C}}}^{2}\\left( H \\right) = \\theta _{0}^{2} - \\left( {g\\mu H + \\Delta } \\right){{{{\\theta }_{0}}} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{{{\\theta }_{0}}} E}} \\right. \\kern-0em} E}$$ . The parameter $${{\\theta }_{0}} = {{\\hbar }^{2}}\\frac{1}{{2D{{m}_{n}}}}$$ is inversely proportional to the constant spin-wave stiffness D of the material. Model calculations for the experiment on small-angle neutron scattering are presented. They convincingly show the possibility of measuring not only the spin-wave stiffness with an accuracy of several percent, but also the nonfield gap Δ with an accuracy of up to 1 μeV.

In this work, we show the nonreciprocal microwave transmission in a cavity magnonic system under the joint mechanism of phase modulation and magnon Kerr nonlinearity effect. In contrast to the schemes based on the standard phase modulation or magnon Kerr nonlinearity, we find that the joint mechanism enables the nonreciprocal transmission even at low power and makes us obtain a high nonreciprocal isolation ratio. Moreover, when two microwave modes are coupled to the magnon mode via a different coupling strength, the presented strong nonreciprocal response occurs, and it makes the nonreciprocal transmission manipulating by the magnetic field within a large adjustable range possible, which overcomes narrow operating band-widths. This study may provide promising opportunities to realize nonreciprocal structures for wave transmission."

        "abstract": "The problem of reflection and refraction of antiplane shear (or magneto-elastic) waves at the interface between two ferromagnetic half-spaces with slipping contact (vacuum gap) is studied for waves propagating normal to the direction of the applied external magnetic field which is assumed to be parallel to the interface. We show the existence of new waves that are localized near the interface between the two ferromagnetic media and accompany the reflected and the transmitted waves. We call the new waves as accompanying surface magneto-elastic (ASME) waves; their amplitudes depend upon values of magnetoelastic parameters of the two media and the intensity of the applied magnetic field. We derive closed-form expressions for magnitudes (coefficients) of the reflected, the refracted (transmitted) and the ASME waves. We show that for a range of values of the applied magnetic field the coefficient of the reflected wave increases and that of the transmitted wave decreases with an increase in the magnitude of the applied magnetic field; these coefficients eventually approach 1 and 0, respectively. That is, the applied external magnetic field can totally eliminate the transmitted wave, and can control energies of the reflected, the refracted and the ASME waves."

        "abstract": "Numerical analysis of the micromagnetic model was used to reveal the ‘resonance’ feature of relaxation processes in nanocrystalline thin magnetic films. This feature manifests itself in the form of sharp broadening of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) line at a certain frequency f _1 depending on magnetic characteristics of the film, and is observed only in films the thickness of which exceeds some threshold value d _min. Sharp broadening of the FMR line is accompanied by significant shift of the resonance field, whereas the shift value changes the sign at frequency ~ f _1. It was shown analytically that the nature of observed effects is associated with the two-magnon process of spin waves scattering on quasi-periodic magnetic microstructure – magnetization ‘ripple’. Obtained expressions for the threshold value of film thickness d _min and frequency of maximum broadening of FMR line f _1 agree well with the results of numerical computation of micromagnetic model."

The large value of J indicates strong initial overlapping of Cu and O wave functions in high- T _ c , materials. It was found that an increase in free carrier concentration results in a rapid increase of magnon damping and the disappearance of the two-magnon peak from RS spectra. A detailed study of electron Raman scattering has been carried out in superconducting and insulating YBa_2Cu_3O_6− x , single crystals. The spectral redistribution at frequencies ω <600 cm^−1 in different polarizations indicate that the superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic. In the normal (metallic) phase the behavior of the imaginary part of the response function R″(ω) in the polarization ( x′x′ ) corresponds to the model of a marginal Fermi liquid, and in the polarization ( x′x′ ), this behavior is independent of the temperature.

        "abstract": "Extensive research has significantly improved the vibration isolation performance of off-road vehicle seat suspensions, effectively addressing issues such as driver fatigue, and low-back pain. However, variations caused by road roughness, vehicle speed, and load can lead to stability switches and sudden events in seat vibration excitation. Ignoring these factors in semi-active and active seat suspensions can cause insufficient robustness and excessive costs. To address this, we propose an intelligent damping switching method that optimizes seat suspension damping mode by considering the stability and suddenness of excitation. Utilizing a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we accurately identify stability, while the multi-input and multi-output optimization (MIMO) method labels the network input through system identification of the seat dynamics model. Event trigger (ET) handles suddenness effectively. By combining these techniques, our approach achieves effective vibration isolation while maintaining the desired suspension deflection. Comparative analysis validates our novel seat suspension control system design approach."

        "abstract": "As the world increasingly turns to renewable energy sources, the integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the grid has emerged as a pivotal solution. Effective control methods are paramount to harnessing the full potential of these grid-connected PV systems. While existing control methods have laid a foundation, there persists a compelling need for innovative approaches capable of surpassing the limitations of conventional methods. This paper introduces a novel nonlinear control approach utilizing an enhanced Lyapunov function for a single-phase PV/grid electric power system. High-performance operation of the solar PV system, interfacing with a grid-connected single-stage inverter, is achieved through the control of maximum PV voltage using predictive voltage control for MPPT. The enhanced Lyapunov function maintains PV voltage stability at the dc-bus by treating the difference between PV voltage and its reference as a controlled state error. Notably, this approach ensures the stability of the closed-loop PV system even under varying solar irradiances. To achieve full active power injection into the grid with high quality, the proposed enhanced Lyapunov function is augmented by integrating an LCL filter with virtual resistance as an active damping circuit for grid current feedback control. This integration introduces an opposing current to the grid-side inductance current. This compensation mechanism corrects the q -axis grid current using the dq-SRF mathematical model of the global PV/grid system. The LCL parameters and virtual resistance design methods are provided. The effectiveness of the enhanced Lyapunov function is demonstrated through simulations using MATLAB/Simulink software. The results showcase outstanding performance when compared to conventional Lyapunov function and sliding mode control strategies in achieving key objectives, including zero state errors, global stability, and the generation of a sinusoidal grid current signal with low total harmonic distortion and the unit power factor at the point of common coupling."

Methods A novel method has been successfully developed to model and analyze the forced damped response of centrifugally stiffened Timoshenko beam. The method uses a single beam element with six physical nodal coordinates. The transverse displacement and rotation of the beam are described using a mixture of polynomial and enriching trigonometric shape functions. The damping matrix is incorporated into the equations of motion (EOM) according to Rayleigh assumption. The damped EOM are expressed in state space form. Results The dynamic characteristics for the rotating forced damped vibration of Timoshenko beam are analyzed by assuming modal damping ratios for the first two modes and then finding the constants for the proportional damping. The EOM are integrated numerically to evaluate the system’s dynamic time response under various rotating speeds, external loading conditions, and modal damping ratios. Notably, the study goes a step further, providing a comprehensive exploration of the frequency response function (FRF) across a spectrum of parameter changes. The validity and efficiency of the developed method are demonstrated through numerical examples across various cases. Conclusions Proportional damping is pivotal for controlling vibrations, stability, and energy dissipation in rotating beams, shaping their response characteristics. It affects the damping ratio, natural frequency, and amplitude of the beam’s response. Higher damping ratios lead to quicker vibration decay, lower natural frequencies, and diminished amplitudes."

In order to improve the problem that the classical control algorithm cannot perfectly balance the driving comfort and road-holding performance when the motorcycle is driving in different road conditions, the hybrid control algorithm based on frequency division (HCFD) is designed. Firstly, the single-axis two-degree-of-freedom suspension model of motorcycle semi-active suspension system (SASS) and the look-up table model of solenoid valve damper are established. After that, the classical SASS control algorithms such as skyhook and groundhook are analyzed. HCFD is designed and verified for its inability to perfectly balance the comfort and road-holding performance of motorcycle. Finally, a real motorcycle experimental platform is built using the rapid control prototype (RCP) based on dSPACE, and the HCFD is tested and verified on washboard roads. The experimental results show that the SASS using the HCFD not only enhances driving comfort but also effectively mitigates concerns related to a decline in road-holding performance.

The inclusion of nonlinear eddy current damping is expected to improve the control performance of optimal TID. In particular, the mechanical model and configuration of proposed EC-TID are introduced in detail. A closed-form solution for EC-TID optimal design in both undamped and damped structures is established based on effective damping ratio enhancement (EDRE) effect. This closed-form solution ensures equivalence of nonlinear eddy current damping through employment of statistical linearization techniques (SLT) with both force-based and energy-based equivalent criteria. The EC-TID control effectiveness obtained through Monte Carlo simulation under white noise excitation, which include effective damping ratio and EDRE effect, verifies the accuracy of the closed-form solution established via SLT, and highlights the importance of a large critical velocity of EC-TID in achieving higher accuracy. Moreover, it has been found that the closed-form solution for EC-TID and eddy-current-based tuned viscous mass damper (EC-TVMD) optimal design exhibit significant similarities when their equivalent damping ratios are identical. Several numerical studies have been conducted to investigate the control performance of EC-TID under real seismic excitations. The results demonstrate that both TID and EC-TID exhibit superior EDRE effects in mitigating the seismic response of structures compared to viscous and eddy current dampers with the same damping parameters. Additionally, EC-TID offers improved performance over TID, including slightly higher effectiveness, pre-designed maximum damping force, and reduced deformation. Noted that EC-TID is more effective than EC-TVMD in reducing structural seismic responses when their equivalent damping ratio is set at 0.03. This finding contrasts with a recent study where TID and tuned viscous mass damper (TVMD) exhibited comparable effectiveness under the same conditions."

The results show that the density of YIG ferrite green body increases with the increase of the forming pressure, while the density of its sintered body shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. At the same time, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of YIG sample first decreases and then increases. Meanwhile, the effects of forming pressure on the saturation magnetization, remanence and coercivity of the sample can be ignored. This study proves that the density and FMR linewidth of YIG materials can be controlled by regulating the forming pressure and the best performance is obtained for the sample prepared under a forming pressure of 5 MPa."

The nanosecond radiation of an yttrium-aluminum garnet laser with a generation wavelength λ = 1.06 μm was used. Solutions with different concentrations of copper sulfate were applied. The structure of the films obtained in this case was compared with the structure of the films obtained as a result of drying solutions without exposure to laser radiation. The resulting films have both ordered and disordered structures. The characteristic dimensions of the structural elements of the films are 0.5–10 μm. The transmission of films in the visible spectral region (400–800 nm) was studied. In general, the resulting films are transparent in this area. Their transmission hardly depends on the wavelength, but it is different for different concentrations of the used solutions of copper sulfate."

The Aslamazov–Larkin (AL) model was used to examine fluctuation regions in resistivity-temperature curves. At high temperatures, short wave fluctuation was observed. A cross-over between short wave fluctuation and the mean-field region was spotted at lower temperatures.

Effects of In^3+-ion doping on microstructural, magnetic, and dielectric properties of Bi-YIG ferrite are investigated and discussed. Results show that In doping does not change the phase of Bi-YIG ferrite but increases lattice constant. Microstructure analysis indicates that In doping not only results in uniform grain shape but also influences grain size (the maximum average size is 3.46 μm at x  = 0.30). Vibrating sample magnetometry results reveal that upon increasing In^3+-ion content from x  = 0.00 to x  = 0.75, saturation magnetization first increases from 14.48 to 24.71 emu/g (at x  = 0.45) and then decreases to 15.43 emu/g (at x  = 0.75).

This work presents a new methodology for fabrication of membrane-assisted elongated YIG nanostructures through the sol-gel method using low-cost materials, and the estimation of the average size of the geometries formed within the pores through ferromagnetic resonance measurements. A precursor solution was deposited on the internal surface of porous aluminum oxide membrane, using an assembly consisting of a vacuum system coupled to an apparatus, which assists in the entry of the used precursor solution, breaking the barriers related to the existing surface tension, with subsequent heat treatment to form the single phase of yttrium iron garnet (YIG). The data collected by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy indicated this result. The study of the contact angle of the precursor solution and the alumina template indicated great compatibility, an angle of 35.4°. SEM analysis showed that elongated structures were deposited inside the pore’s walls, with different lengths up to 3 micrometers and the EDS analysis showed the presence of the main elements of the YIG phase. The Kittel’s equation and FMR spectral data were used to estimate the mean size of the elongated nanostructures. We found six different size categories with 1856, 1768, 1661, 1588, 1570, 1498 nm .

A promising structure for information storage is the Skyrmion, a domain wall quasi-particle. It has been shown that the stabilization of a Skyrmion can be energetically favorable with the addition of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) through the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya Interaction (DMI). This interaction should be largest in metals, but still present in insulators. To produce spintronic devices using YIG, we must evaluate the DMI interaction inherent in the substrate used to grow the YIG, which is generally Gadolinium Gallium Garnet (GGG).

While plastid MSH1 maintains nuclear epigenome plasticity and affects plant development patterns, mitochondrial MSH1 suppresses illegitimate recombination within the mitochondrial genome, affects mitochondrial genome substoichiometric shifting activity and induces cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in crops. However, a detailed functional investigation of onion MSH1 has yet to be achieved. Materials and results The homology analysis of onion genome database identified a single copy of the AcMSH1 gene in the onion cv. Bhima Super. In silico analysis of AcMSH1 protein sequence revealed the presence of 6 conserved functional domains including a unique MSH1-specific GIY-YIG endonuclease domain at the C-terminal end. At N-terminal end, it has signal peptide sequences targeting chloroplast and mitochondria. The concentration of AcMSH1 was found to be highest in isolated mitochondria, followed by chloroplasts, and negligible in the cytoplasmic fraction; which proved its localization to the mitochondria and chloroplasts. Quantitative expression analysis revealed that AcMSH1 protein levels were highest in leaves, followed by flower buds, root tips, flowers, and umbels, with the lowest amount found in callus tissue. Conclusion Onion genome has single copy of MSH1, with characteristic GIY-YIG endonuclease domain. AcMSH1 targeted towards both chloroplasts and mitochondria.

The threshold powers of transition and bistable region strongly depend on magnon dissipation rate, photon-magnon coupling strength, and Kerr nonlinear strength.

Just as physical and chemical tuning are at the heart of our ability to design, understand, and control advanced materials in their bulk form, size–shape tuning is of emerging importance in the field of functional oxide nanomaterials. This is because finite length scale effects (1) expand the usable structure–property phase space and (2) can drive emergent phenomena. And in the same way that optical spectroscopy reveals the dynamics of bulk materials, it is beginning to do so in nanoscale compounds, particularly in combination with first principles calculations and various confinement models. This review takes the case study approach, highlighting recent findings in selected transition metal oxides where various types of length scale effects are important. Systems of interest include (1) the Mott–Hubbard compound VO_2, (2) La_0.5Sr_1.5MnO_4 in high magnetic field, (3) pristine and chemically substituted vanadium oxide nanoscrolls, (4) quantum size effects in ZnO and TiO_2, (5) polar oxide thin films and nanoparticles based upon BiFeO_3, and (6) H_2 binding in metal-organic frameworks.

As a result, there is a growing urgency for two-dimensional half-metallic materials with a high Curie temperature ( T _C). This study presents a theoretical investigation of the fundamental electromagnetic properties of the monolayer hexagonal lattice of Mn_2X_3 (X = S, Se, Te). Additionally, the potential application of Mn_2X_3 as magneto-resistive components is explored. All three of them fall into the category of ferromagnetic half-metals. In particular, the Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the T _C of Mn_2S_3 reachs 381 K, noticeably greater than room temperature. These findings present notable advantages for the application of Mn_2S_3 in spintronic devices. Hence, a prominent spin filtering effect is apparent when employing non-equilibrium Green’s function simulations to examine the transport parameters. The resulting current magnitude is approximately 2 × 10^4 nA, while the peak gigantic magnetoresistance exhibits a substantial value of 8.36 × 10^16 %. It is noteworthy that the device demonstrates a substantial spin Seebeck effect when the temperature differential between the electrodes is modified. In brief, Mn_2X_3 exhibits outstanding features as a high T _C half-metal, exhibiting exceptional capabilities in electrical and thermal drives spin transport.

The electronic band and density of the state of FeMnZnSi and FeMnZnGe indicated that they are half-metallic with an indirect and direct band gap of 0.329 and 0.342 eV, respectively. The magnetic moments derived from magnetic calculations suggested that both alloys satisfied the Slater–Pauling rule of $${M}_{t}={Z}_{t}-28$$ M t = Z t - 28 with a total magnetic moment of 3 µB. Moreover, the effects of the uniform strain of the lattice constant on the half-metallicity of alloys were analyzed. The lattice constants of FeMnZnSi and FeMnZnGe exhibited half-metallic properties ranging from − 5 to 21% and − 13 to 14%, respectively. Furthermore, after using Si as the lattice constant, FeMnZn Z ( Z  = Sn, Pb) exhibited a magnetic moment of 3 µB, which satisfied the Slater–Pauling rule of $${M}_{t}={Z}_{t}-28$$ M t = Z t - 28 , and demonstrated half-metallic properties.

The predicted total magnetic moments for the transition metals Os and Ir are 4.0 μB and 3.0 μB with TB-mBJ and are 2.0 μB and 3.0 μB using the hybrid functional (HSE06) for compounds Cd_0.75Os_0.25S and Cd_0.75Ir_0.25S, respectively. The generation of magnetic moments and spin-polarization in these alloys is directly linked to the contribution coming from TM-5d states. The ferromagnetic properties of these alloys were predicted by the computed exchange constants Besides, the increase in the porosity paramete $$N_{0\\alpha }$$ N 0 α and $$N_{0\\beta }$$ N 0 β . The Total and partial densities of states (TDOS/PDOS) and the behavior of electronic band structures (EBS) were also calculated to describe the ferromagnetic semiconducting and half-metallic (HM) characteristics with TB-mBJ and the hybrid functional (HSE06). According to the findings, Cd_0.75Os_0.25S is a half-metallic ferromagnetic (HM) material with a full polarization spin distribution of electrons at the Fermi energy level, exhibiting metallicity for the majority spin and a semiconducting nature for the minority spin. In contrast, Cd_0.75Ir_0.25S is a ferromagnetic half-semiconductor (HSC) with two distinct gaps depending on the up and down spin configurations. Calculations of the elastic constants, Young and shear moduli reveal that the compound Cd_0.75TM_0.25S (TM = Os or Ir) is mechanically stable, has a high degree of anisotropy, and is naturally ductile. Furthermore, the “quasi-harmonic Debye model” was performed to examine the thermodynamic properties of the studied compounds, including the thermal capacity, entropy and Debye temperature."

        "abstract": "In the present work, the optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties of RbYX (X = Si, Ge) half-Heusler (h–H) compounds are investigated. These compounds have 8 valence electrons. Thequantum mechanical model, known as density functionaltheory (DFT) and WIEN2k simulation package are used to investigate the elastic, optical, and thermoelectric properties. Further, the full Potential (FP)—LAPW approach is used to conduct the computations. The measured optimized lattice constants of 7.2 and 7.3 Å for RbYSi and RbYGe are obtained. The density of states (TDOS and PDOS) as well as band structure are studied and analyzed. The direct–energy band gap. of 0.61 and 0.63 eV are observed which shows the semiconducting behavior of the alloys. The measured optical reflectivity of RbYX (X = Si, Ge) lies in the ultra-violet region (UV). The absorption coefficients greater than 10^4 cm^−1 are observed in the visible and ultraviolet regions. The other optical properties like the refractive index (n), electron-energy loss (I), extinction coefficient (K), and optical conductivity ( $$\\sigma$$ σ ) were also investigated using the dielectric function. Results revealed that the alloys are promising candidates for optoelectronic and photovoltaic. The thermoelectric properties are also calculated using the Boltzmann. transport equations included in the BoltzTraP2 package. The calculated power factor for RbYSi and RbYGe are 4.18 × 10^11 WK^−2 cm^−1 s^−1 and 4.0 × 10^11 WK^−2 cm^−1 s^−1.

To explore and predict the various physical properties of Co-based Heusler alloy, Co_2MnSi (CMS), First principles calculations are of interest and has been used in the present study. Optimized E–V curves represent that CMS alloy is most stable in its magnetic L2_1 structural phase. The electronic charge density plot represents the ionic bonding along with co-valent character for the compound. DOS and BS calculations shows 100% spin polarization at Fermi level (E_F) which confirms the half metallic character of the compound. DOS exhibited the prominent role of Co-3d and Mn-3d electronic states along with Si-2p electronic states. Estimated magnetic moment of Co_2MnSi Heusler alloy was found to be ~ 5μ_B per f. u. which is in line with the Slater-Pauling behaviour.

The exchange–correlation term has been examined inside the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as implemented in the Wien2k code. According to predictions, the type 3 structure of atoms will be the tremendous, optimum, and have the smallest amount of energy. The formation energy of CoMnSb and FeMnSb was minimum so it demonstrates that these alloys are optimized. CoMnSb and FeMnSb are half-metallic (HM) having the value of magnetic moment 3µ_B and 2µ_B, respectively in good agreement with the Slater-Pauling rule. These results suggest that the Mn atoms are the primary source of the magnetic moment. The values of elastic constants were determined by the crystal structure’s symmetry. Additionally, the bulk modulus B , shear modulus G , Young’s modulus E , as well as Poisson’s ratio $$v$$ v have been determined using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) method.

Mn_2TiSi Heusler alloy was synthesized by a conventional vacuum arc remelting process. The formation of Heusler phase along with the secondary phases was observed after annealing it at 773 K for 120 h. The X-ray diffraction pattern illustrates the presence of cubic B2 disordered phase along with a secondary phase with a lattice parameter of 5.82 Å. The microstructure and compositional analysis of Mn_2TiSi alloy shows the presence of distribution of Mn, Ti, and Si elements according to their stoichiometric ratio. The magnetic measurements show a ferromagnetic nature with Curie temperature ( T _C) around 203 K. With low magnetic moment and coercivity, Mn_2TiSi can be used for switching applications because of its fast magnetization reversal. So, Mn_2TiSi becomes the greatest choice for use in spintronics due to its low magnetic moment and low coercivity."

Precise tuning of PMA requires highly controllable modification methods compatible with existing electronic device fabrication technology. In this study, we report on the effects of low-energy (30 keV) Ar and Ne ion irradiation on the PMA of cobalt-iron-boron alloy (CoFeB) based thin films for fluences between 1 × 10^13 ions·cm^−2 and 1 × 10^15 ions·﻿cm^−2 and resultant displacement per atom (DPA) of 0.13–13 and 0.32–32 for Ne and Ar ions, respectively. Our results showed that ion irradiation reduced the PMA in CoFeB layer. The effective anisotropy energy, K_eff ≈ 64 kJ·m^−3 for un-irradiated CoFeB stacks reduced to ≈ 50 kJ·m^−3 and ≈ 30 kJ·m^−3 for stacks irradiated with 1 × 10^13 Ne·cm^−2 and with 1 × 10^13 Ar·cm^−2, respectively. Monte Carlo-based simulations for ion irradiation showed significant intermixing of interface layers upon irradiation leading to decrease in Fe–O and Fe/Co–W orbital hybridization, which reduced the PMA. Furthermore, intermixing of Fe/Co with W resulted in the formation of paramagnetic phases, which decreased the saturation magnetization. Our study shows that ion irradiation is an effective method for tuning PMA in MTJs, and the extent of change in PMA can be directly correlated with the DPA."

X-ray diffraction results show that as-deposited films are amorphous and retain their nature upon annealing up to 350 °C. Magnetization reversal results exhibit anisotropic behavior in both as-deposited and annealed samples. The random anisotropy model explains the change in coercivity in the transverse axis with respect to the longitudinal axis for CFB annealed at 350 °C. Broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectra reveal that the damping parameter decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Ultra-low damping of 0.004 is obtained with annealing at 350 °C. Surface topographical images from atomic force microscopy are rewarded for supporting the observed variation of the damping constant. Our systematic study gives an insight into CFB magnetization reversal and dynamics for developing ultra-low damping magnetic thin films via annealing."

        "abstract": "Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy-based magnetic tunnel junctions (p-MTJs) with low Gilbert damping constant (α) are of particular interest for fast and low-power consumption magnetic random-access memory (MRAM). However, obtaining a faster switching speed and lower power consumption is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a Mo-based perpendicular double free layer structure with a low Gilbert damping constant of 0.02 relative to W-based films, as measured by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect equipment. To show the influence of different film structures on the Gilbert damping constant, we measured the Mo-based single free layer. Thereafter, we deposited the full stacks with the Mo-based double free layer and obtained a high tunneling magnetoresistance of 136.3% and high thermal stability. The results of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the Mo-based films had better crystallinity, sharper interfaces, and weaker diffusion than the W-based films and thus produced a weaker external contribution of the Gilbert damping constant. As a result of the weak spin-orbit coupling in the Mo-based structure, the intrinsic contribution of the Gilbert damping constant was also weak, thereby leading to the small Gilbert damping constant of the Mo-based stacks. In addition, the macro-spin simulation results demonstrated that the magnetization switching by the spin transfer torque of the Mo-based MTJs was faster than that of the W-based MTJs. These findings help to understand the mechanism behind the good performance of Mo-based p-MTJ films and show the great promise of these structures in low-power consumption MRAM or other spintronic devices."

While the M _ s and K _ eff values were modified, the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of the MTJs were maintained, even though the CoFeB thickness was decreased by half. Moreover, an asymmetric bias voltage dependence of TMR was suppressed in the MTJs with FeNiSiB/CoFeB hybrid free layers due to improvements in the interface quality between the CoFeB/MgO interfaces.

Co_40Fe_40B_20 and Ni_80Fe_20 films of different nanometric thicknesses were stretched by more than 10% and in situ probed by atomic force microscopy measurements to determine their irreversible mechanical behavior (multi-cracking, buckling). Once these phenomena have been well identified, magnetic behavior of these stretched systems has been studied by ferromagnetic resonance to measure resulting magnetic anisotropy and damping evolutions. All of these experimental studies show that the magnetic properties are mainly affected by the stresses generated during the damage but not by the local discontinuities induced by the numerous cracks and buckles. This is in particular confirmed by the almost zero sensitivity to the damage of the magnetic properties of Ni_80Fe_20 alloy which is known for its vanishing magnetostriction."

Our results demonstrate that, even though the MNS’s have identical elemental compositions, their IR spectra differ significantly. The reason for this is that the main contribution to the IR spectrum of the [(CoFeB)_60C_40/SiO_2]_200 MNS is made by its SiO_2 interlayers. The formation of other bonds with oxygen and silicon is blocked by the carbon present in the (CoFeB)_60C_40 composite layers, as evidenced by the presence of the strongest mode in the IR spectra of this structure, which corresponds to boron carbide, BC. The considerable intensity redistribution to the low-frequency region in the IR spectrum of the [(CoFeB)_34(SiO_2)_66/C]_46 MNS, containing carbon interlayers, is due to the incorporation of nominal SiO2 into the metal-containing composite layers and the partial redistribution of oxygen bonds from the SiO_2 to the 3d transition metals, resulting in the formation of metal oxides and a silicon suboxide. The interaction of the carbon present in the interlayers between the composite layers with elements of the composite layers, in particular with boron, is considerably weaker in comparison with the other MNS, [(CoFeB)_60C_40/SiO_2]_200, which has oxide interlayers."

The axis of the resulting magnetic anisotropy was found to make an angle of 45° with the magnetic anisotropy axes of individual layers. The magnetization reversal processes in the samples are considered taking into account both the coherent magnetic moment rotation and the nucleation of reverse magnetization domains and domain wall motion."

The [FeNi/Cu]_5/[Cu/[Cu/FeNi]_5 film element with transverse magnetic anisotropy is used as a sensing element of the prototype of detector of weak magnetic fields operating on the basis of the magnetoimpedance (MI) effect. It is shown that there is a linear dependence of the specific magnetization on the concentration of microparticles in the range of 0–70 wt % despite notable differences in the structure of composites. Using the MI prototype of the weak field detector, a linear dependence of the change of the MI effect on the concentration of FeO_ x microparticles in the frequency range of 80–260 MHz is found. It is shown that the esigned composites and film elements based on permalloy are complementary in terms of their functional properties and can be used as a model pair for magnetic detection."

        "abstract": "This work focuses on the structure and magnetic properties of Fe-50wt% Ni permalloy manufactured from the pre-alloyed powder by selective laser melting (SLM). The selective laser melted (SLMed) alloys were characterized by a 3D profilometer, optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, etc. The effects of the volume energy density of laser (LVED) on structure, and magnetic properties with coercivity ( H _c), remanence ( B _r), and power losses ( P _50-1), were evaluated and discussed systematically. The results show that the relative porosity rate and the surface roughness of the SLMed specimens decreased with the increase in LVED. Only the γ-(FeNi) phase was detected in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the SLMed permalloys fabricated from the different LVEDs. Statistical analysis of optical microscopy images indicated that the grain coarsened at higher LVED. Furthermore, the microstructure of the SLMed parts was a typical columnar structure with an oriented growth of building direction. The highest microhardness reached 198 HV_0.1. Besides, the magnetic properties including B _r, H _c, and P _50-1 of SLMed samples decreased when the LVED ranged from 33.3 to 60.0 J/mm^3 firstly and then increased while LVED further up to 93.3 J/mm^3, which is related to the decrease in porosity and the increase in grain size, while the higher residual stress and microcracks presented in the samples manufactured using very high LVED. The observed evolution of magnetic properties and LVED provides a good compromise in terms of reduced porosity and crack formation for the fabrication of SLMed Fe-50wt% Ni permalloy. The theoretical mechanism in this study can offer guidance to further investigate SLMed soft magnetic alloys."

Well-aligned and uniform permalloy nanochains have been synthesized using a chemical synthesis method under applied magnetic fields. The morphological, microstructural and compositional studies confirm the linear distribution of stoichiometric permalloy nanoparticles with spherical shape along the applied magnetic field to form chain-like structure. Magnetic measurements also demonstrate that the magnetization reversal is mainly attributed to the spherical vortices and shape anisotropy of the chains and typical hard and easy-axis magnetic hysteresis loops.

        "abstract": "In MEMS fabrication, metallic films deposition by ion reduction from a solution may be performed either with electroplating or electroless process. Both techniques are suitable for MEMS application, depending on the desired deposit proprieties and on the required integration process. Deposition rate in electroless processes is generally quite slow, so for thick deposits, Electro-Chemical Deposition (ECD) is usually preferred. Furthermore, when the required metal thickness is higher than 0.5–1.0 μm and/or the active area (metal which remains on wafer) is very low, through-mask ECD is preferred with respect to a PVD/wet etch patterning approach. This is because in the latter case there is a higher metal waste and therefore a consequent higher cost. Through-mask electrochemical deposition is commonly used to generate bumps for wiring interconnections (e.g., to connect MEMS sensor with its ASIC) and for wafer to wafer bonding. Thick metal structures are also required in electromagnetic devices where actuation occurs (e.g., μMirror, ref. chapter). Section 8.1 of this chapter provides a summary of electroplating theory, while process integration on silicon wafers and ECD front-end tools are described in Sects. 8.2 and 8.3 , respectively. Peculiar ECD techniques used in MEMS field like stacked metal plating and alloy plating are presented in Sects. 8.4 and 8.5 .

Five isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were performed; the basal diet served as a control with no Fe added, whereas the experimental diets were shaped by adding bulk-Fe_2O_3 and nano-Fe_2O_3 to the basal diet to preserve Fe levels at 0.2 and 0.4 mg kg^−1, respectively. Results indicated that superior growth performance was recorded in fish-fed diets supplemented with 0.4 nano-Fe_2O_3 mg kg^−1 diet. In addition, the highest ( P  ≤ 0.05) survival rate, absorption area of villous (AAV), mucosal to serosal amplification ratio (MSR), and villi parameters (height and width) were noticed in fish fed diet enrichment with either bulk or nano-Fe_2O_3 source. However, the superiority observed in nano-Fe_2O_3 fish groups. Also, the highest values of plasma albumin, total protein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), white blood cells (WBCs), and lymphocyte absolute count (LYM) ( P  ≤ 0.05) recorded in fish fed a diet supplemented with nano-Fe_2O_3 versus the basal diet.

Ferric oxide (Fe_3O_4) has a large specific surface area and can be functionalized by inorganic modification to form complex magnetic drug delivery systems. Herein, Fe_3O_4 was surface-modified with citric acid and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (via) the Mitsunobu reaction and then covalently bound to CST. Finally, magnetic microbubbles (MMBs) containing perfluoropropane (C_3F_8) and Fe_3O_4-PEG_2K-CST particles were constructed with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as the shell membrane. In vitro studies showed that ultrasound-mediated MMBs exhibited improved inhibition of VX2 cell proliferation compared to inhibition achieved using MMBs without ultrasound mediation, blank MMBs, or free CST. In ultrasound mode, MMBs have favorable imaging properties. After the application of a high mechanical index, MMBs collapse through the cavitation effect, releasing their internal Fe_3O_4-PEG_2K-CST. The CST is then delivered to the tumor microenvironment under acidic conditions. In magnetic resonance imaging T2 mode, a specific hypointense signal was observed in the tumor area compared with that before treatment, whereas no significant change occurred in the signal intensity of the surrounding organs. After treatment, pathological examination of tumor-bearing rabbit tissues showed that iron elements accumulated in several apoptosis cells in the tumor area, with no apparent abnormalities found in other areas. Thus, ultrasound-mediated MMBs could significantly improve the drug uptake of solid tumors and inhibit tumor growth with favorable biological safety. Graphical Abstract "

Despite increased outer coating porosity, the corrosion resistance of Zn- and ZnSn-coated steels significantly improves after heat treatment, attributed to the formation of intermetallic phases. This study employs small- and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering (SANS and USANS) to investigate the behavior of mechanically plated Zn and ZnSn coatings pre- and post-heat treatment. In the presence of a relatively thick steel substrate, strong multiple scattering occurs. However, by identifying a specific high Q -range region where multiple scattering is negligible, we reveal small but significant differences. Porod’s slopes, denoted as ‘ n ’, are calculated for uncoated steel, and Zn- and ZnSn-coated steels (both with and without heat treatment). These slope values reflect contributions from different interfaces on the particles’ surface roughness. Despite the challenges of multiple scattering, our findings offer valuable insights into coatings’ behavior. The study lays a foundation for future investigations into coating behavior using SANS/USANS techniques."

The studied materials were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM–EDX and FTIR methods. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the zeolite structure was not affected by the catalyst preparation method. BET results revealed that Fe-FAU possess a trimodal structure (micro, meso and macropores) with a porosity of 0.28 cm^3/g.

At 150 °C, the denitrification efficiency of Fe–Mn/TiO_2 (0.3) catalyst was 97.7%.

These factors facilitated the adsorption and activation of NH_3 as well as the oxidation of NO to NO_2, thus increasing the low-temperature redox capacity of the catalyst.

The tribological properties of the as-synthesized Ni nanoparticles were evaluated with a four-ball tribometer, and their tribomechanism was investigated based on the characterizations of the tribofilm on rubbed steel surfaces by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the Ni nanoparticles in-situ prepared in the RO with a mass fraction of 0.3% can reduce the wear scar diameter (WSD) of the steel ball by 36%.

On the other hand, Ni nanoparticles participate in tribochemical reactions with atmospheric O and steel substrate to form the tribochemical reaction film on the rubbed steel surfaces with the assistance of friction-induced heat and applied normal load. In addition, an amorphous carbon film is formed on the rubbed surface via the carbonization of base oil under the catalysis of Ni nanoparticles. The adsorbed Ni layer, the tribochemical reaction film, and the carbon layer comprise a composite tribofilm composed of amorphous carbon, polar fatty acid, metallic nickel, iron oxides, and nickel oxides on the rubbed steel surfaces, which contributes to significantly improving the antiwear ability and load-carrying capacity of the RO for the steel–steel sliding pair."

Gird welds in such pipes are conventionally made using alloy 625 filler metal. However, alloy 625 weld metal cannot meet the base metal yield strength overmatching requirement for subsea reel lay installation. This study explored materials selection and process development for low-alloy steel girth welds in API 5L Grade X65 steel pipes, internally clad with alloy 625. Welding with a higher melting point filler metal over a lower melting substrate, i.e., low-alloy steel over Ni-based alloy, is impractical due to increased susceptibility to solidification cracking and solidification shrinkage porosity. Pseudo-binary phase diagrams developed for various combinations of low alloy steel filler metals and Ni-based alloy substrates identified good compatibility between ER80S-G filler metal and alloy 686. The solidification temperature range and the tendency for partitioning of alloying elements were significantly lower throughout the entire ER80S-G/alloy 686 dilution range than in the low alloy steel filler metals/alloy 625 combinations. Extensive process optimization effort to reduce the dilution of alloy 686 root pass in the low-alloy steel weld metal and avoid incomplete fusion defects allowed for the production of defect-free girth welds.

Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis and radical quenching experiments indicated that SO_4^•− and ^•OH were the predominant radical species under acidic and alkaline conditions. Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer tests revealed the Fe-gallic acid chelation could regulate the concentration of iron ions and improve the reactivity of gallic acid-Fe/Ni. These results demonstrated that the gallic acid-Fe/Ni-persulfate system was a promising strategy for treating composite chlorinated ethenes-containing wastewater."

This was followed by combining CoCrMo powder and reinforcing phase powder. Subsequently, SLM processing was employed to form CoCrMo, Al_2O_3–CoCrMo (CCMA), and Ni@Al_2O_3–CoCrMo (CCMN) composites. The samples’ hardness, wear resistance, and strength were determined. Employing FIB technology, the samples were examined for morphology, energy spectrum, and electron diffraction patterns. The results indicated that the CCMN sample displayed optimal hardness and friction resistance. While the tensile strength of the CCMN sample was slightly below international standards, an enhancement in elongation was observed, effectively striking a balance between strength and plasticity.

A double bath scheme was adopted, and the bath temperature was also varied to get coatings in different boron range. The double bath coatings have higher microhardness, scratch hardness, wear and corrosion resistance compared to single bath deposits. The double bath scheme led to the formation of coatings with a compact crack-free morphology except at 95 °C bath temperature. The improvement in hardness was 16.85, 11.43 and 10% at 85, 90 and 95 °C bath temperature compared to the single bath coatings. The increase in scratch hardness was within 20–22%. A higher corrosion potential of − 180 and − 178 mV was also seen."

        "abstract": "Single-phase concentrated solid solution alloys (SP-CSAs), including high-entropy alloys, have received extensive attention due to their excellent irradiation resistance. In this work, displacement cascade simulations are conducted using the molecular dynamics method to study the evolution of defects in Ni-based SP-CSAs. Compared with pure Ni, the NiCr, NiCo, and NiCu alloys exhibit a larger number of Frankel pairs (FPs) in the thermal peak stage, but a smaller number of surviving FPs. However, the NiFe alloy displays the opposite phenomenon. To explain these different observations for NiFe and other alloys, the formation energy and migration energy of interstitials/vacancies are calculated. In the NiFe alloy, both the formation energy and migration energy barrier are higher. On the other hand, in NiCr and other alloys, the formation energy of interstitials/vacancies is lower, as is the migration energy barrier of interstitials. The energy analysis agrees well with previous observations. The present work provides new insights into the mechanism behind the irradiation resistance of binary Ni-based SP-CSAs."

        "abstract": "Magmatic Ni–sulfide ore deposits are generally associated with basaltic to komatiitic igneous rocks that originate by partial melting of the mantle, which is usually modelled as a uniform four-phase peridotite. Existing models accept that the key metal contributors to mantle melts are olivine (Ni) and sulfide (Cu, platinum group elements (PGEs) and minor Ni). However, melting in the mantle commonly begins in volumetrically minor mantle assemblages such as hydrous pyroxenites that occur as veins in the peridotite mantle, which are rich in the hydrous minerals phlogopite, amphibole and apatite. The contribution of hydrous pyroxenites to the metal endowment of mantle melts may have been underestimated or overlooked in the past, partly because evidence of their input is partially erased as melting intensifies to involve peridotite. Here, we compile new results from experiments and natural rocks which demonstrate that the hydrous minerals such as phlogopite, amphiboles and apatite all have high partition coefficients for Ni (3–20) and may be important repositories for Ni in mantle sources of igneous rocks. This implies that hydrous minerals hosted in metasomatic mantle lithologies such as hydrous pyroxenites may be important contributors to some magmatic Ni–sulfide ore systems. Hydrous pyroxenites contain hydrous minerals in large modal abundances up to 30–40 vol% in addition to clinopyroxene and a few vol% of oxide phases, such as rutile and ilmenite. These mantle lithologies are commonly associated with cratonic and continental regions, where low-temperature, low-degree volatile-rich melts commonly modify lithospheric peridotite mantle, depositing variable hydrous pyroxenites. The lower melting temperatures of hydrous minerals in hydrous pyroxenite lithologies also means that the generation of magmatic ore deposits may not require a major thermal perturbation such as a plume, as the melting temperatures of hydrous pyroxenites lie around 300–350 °C lower than dry peridotites. Partial melts of hydrous pyroxenite are more voluminous at low temperatures than melts of peridotite would be. Furthermore, it is argued in the following that they would contain similar or even higher concentrations of Ni. Thus, predictive exploration models should consider domains of the lithospheric mantle where hydrous pyroxenites may be localised and concentrated, as they may have been episodically melted throughout the long-lived geological evolution of cratonic blocks, yielding Ni-rich melts that may be hosted in conduits of varying size and geometry at various crustal levels."

        "abstract": "The hot compression behavior and tensile strength after compression of a new Ni–Co-based superalloy produced using electron beam smelting layered (EBSL) solidification technology were investigated. Isothermal compression tests were performed at temperatures of 1120 ℃ and 1150 ℃, with strain rates of 1 s^−1 and 0.01 s^−1, reaching a true strain of 0.51. Tensile strength was evaluated at room temperature. The results revealed that this EBSL technology accelerates dynamic recrystallization (DRX), without compromising the strength of alloy. A significant correlation between the volume fraction of DRX and the strain rate was observed, with higher fractions at lower strain rates, leading to higher tensile strength. Additionally, at the same strain rate, the specimens compressed at 1120 ℃ exhibited higher tensile strength due to undissolved γ ′ precipitates. After solution and aging heat treatment, the alloy maintained high tensile strength. The results suggested that the EBSL Ni–Co-based superalloy offers excellent prospects for practical applications."

However, the degradation of HBCD has received little attention from researchers. Due to its bioaccumulative and hazardous properties, an appropriate strategy for its remediation is required. In this study, we investigated the biodegradation of HBCD using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under optimized conditions. The Box-Behnken design (BBD) was implemented for the optimization of the physical degradation parameters of HBCD. S. oneidensis MR-1 showed the best degradation performance at a temperature of 30 °C, pH 7, and agitation speed of 115 rpm, with an HBCD concentration of 1125 μg/L in mineral salt medium (MSM). The strain tolerated up to 2000 μg/L HBCD. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified three intermediates, including 2-bromo dodecane, 2,7,10-trimethyldodecane, and 4-methyl-1-decene. The results provide an insightful understanding of the biodegradation of HBCD by S. oneidensis MR-1 under optimized conditions and could pave the way for further eco-friendly applications.

Ferric oxide (Fe_3O_4) has a large specific surface area and can be functionalized by inorganic modification to form complex magnetic drug delivery systems. Herein, Fe_3O_4 was surface-modified with citric acid and polyethylene glycol (PEG) (via) the Mitsunobu reaction and then covalently bound to CST. Finally, magnetic microbubbles (MMBs) containing perfluoropropane (C_3F_8) and Fe_3O_4-PEG_2K-CST particles were constructed with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as the shell membrane. In vitro studies showed that ultrasound-mediated MMBs exhibited improved inhibition of VX2 cell proliferation compared to inhibition achieved using MMBs without ultrasound mediation, blank MMBs, or free CST. In ultrasound mode, MMBs have favorable imaging properties. After the application of a high mechanical index, MMBs collapse through the cavitation effect, releasing their internal Fe_3O_4-PEG_2K-CST. The CST is then delivered to the tumor microenvironment under acidic conditions. In magnetic resonance imaging T2 mode, a specific hypointense signal was observed in the tumor area compared with that before treatment, whereas no significant change occurred in the signal intensity of the surrounding organs. After treatment, pathological examination of tumor-bearing rabbit tissues showed that iron elements accumulated in several apoptosis cells in the tumor area, with no apparent abnormalities found in other areas. Thus, ultrasound-mediated MMBs could significantly improve the drug uptake of solid tumors and inhibit tumor growth with favorable biological safety. Graphical Abstract "

Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for wound repair; the inhibition of enzymes involved prevents a post-prandial rise in blood glucose. Sphenocentrum jollyanum Pierre, Menispermaceae, is traditionally employed in folklore to manage chronic wounds. The present study combined the anti-hyperglycemic effect of acarbose and wound healing potentials of S. jollyanum as a modality for wound treatment in diabetic rats. Acarbose (25 mg/kg) was orally administered while the extracts of root and leaf were topically applied both for 14 post-wound days in high-fat diet/streptozotocin–induced diabetic rats. A significant reduction in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), number of microbial colonies, and activities of myeloperoxidase with a concomitant increase in the level of vascular endothelial growth factor were observed on wounds of diabetic rats. Dereplication of compounds in the plant material was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. It revealed the presence of several phenolic compounds with p -coumaric acid (7.4 mg/100 g) and kaempferol (18.2 mg/100 g) being the highest quantified in the root and leaf, respectively. The topical use of S. jollyanum co-administered with oral acarbose effectively enhanced wound healing and may represent a therapeutic approach for diabetic wound management. Graphical Abstract "

However, CO $$_2$$ 2 is chemically inert and room temperature detection of this gas is rare, especially using undoped binary oxides such as tungsten oxide (WO $$_3$$ 3 ) and nickel oxide (NiO). This study reports on the preparation and investigation of a nickel tungstate (NiWO $$_4$$ 4 ) pellet-based sensor for room temperature detection of CO $$_2$$ 2 . The mixed oxide is prepared by first physically mixing NiO and WO $$_3$$ 3 and then compacting them with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) binder using a hydraulic press. These pellets are then sintered in the solid state at 900 $$^{\\circ }\\hbox {C}$$ ∘ C for 2 h and the resultant product is structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The optical band gap is measured using UV–Vis spectroscopy in reflectance mode. The gas sensing behavior of the fabricated sensor is investigated at different concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO $$_2$$ 2 ) at room temperature and measuring the change in electrical resistance. The obtained results showed that the response of the NiWO $$_4$$ 4 sensor is greatly improved when compared to its binary constituents. This can be attributed to the hetero-contacts formed in the sintered material and also the increase in porosity of the mixed oxide when compared with pure WO $$_3$$ 3 . Further, the proposed mechanism that explains CO $$_2$$ 2 sensing is discussed for NiWO $$_4$$ 4 based on the formation of p – p junction between the constituents.

        "abstract": "Background Increasing evidence suggests a double-faceted role of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) following infection by a variety of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Although α-syn accumulation is known to contribute to cell toxicity and the development and/or exacerbation of neuropathological manifestations, it is also a key to sustaining anti-viral innate immunity. Consistently with α-syn aggregation as a hallmark of Parkinson's disease, most studies investigating the biological function of α-syn focused on neural cells, while reports on the role of α-syn in periphery are limited, especially in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Results herein obtained by real time qPCR, immunofluorescence and western blot indicate that α-syn upregulation in peripheral cells occurs as a Type-I Interferon (IFN)-related response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Noteworthy, this effect mostly involves α-syn multimers, and the dynamic α-syn multimer:monomer ratio. Administration of excess α-syn monomers promoted SARS-CoV-2 replication along with downregulation of IFN-Stimulated Genes (ISGs) in epithelial lung cells, which was associated with reduced α-syn multimers and α-syn multimer:monomer ratio. These effects were prevented by combined administration of IFN-β, which hindered virus replication and upregulated ISGs, meanwhile increasing both α-syn multimers and α-syn multimer:monomer ratio in the absence of cell toxicity. Finally, in endothelial cells displaying abortive SARS-CoV-2 replication, α-syn multimers, and multimer:monomer ratio were not reduced following exposure to the virus and exogenous α-syn, suggesting that only productive viral infection impairs α-syn multimerization and multimer:monomer equilibrium. Conclusions Our study provides novel insights into the biology of α-syn, showing that its dynamic conformations are implicated in the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection in peripheral cells. In particular, our results suggest that promotion of non-toxic α-syn multimers likely occurs as a Type-I IFN-related biological response which partakes in the suppression of viral replication. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings in neuronal cells as well as animal models, and to ascertain the nature of such α-syn conformations."

The sampled lakes were located in the páramos of Salve Facha and Antisana y Mojanda (northern region of Ecuadorian Andes), along an elevational gradient from 2213 to 4361 m above sea level, as well as a gradient of lake surface area (0.003–6.1 km^2) and depth (1–74 m). Most lakes were characterized by lower values of the partial pressure of CO_2 (pCO_2) (644–2152 ppm) than usually attributed to tropical lakes (~ 1900 ppm). Three lakes influenced by volcanic inputs were characterized by the highest pCO_2 values (3269–10,069 ppm), while two lakes bordered by large cities were characterized by the lowest pCO_2 values (208–254 ppm). Dissolved CH_4 concentrations ranged between 170 and 24,908 nmol/L and were negatively correlated to lake area and depth. N_2O saturation levels ranged between 64% and 101%. The surface waters were undersaturated in N_2O with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, probably due to inputs of soil–water with low N_2O levels owing to denitrification in soils. The data obtained in the sampled highland lakes was combined with published data from lowland lakes (elevation < 500 m, n  = 17 for CO_2 and n  = 16 for CH_4) to derive relations between CO_2 and CH_4 and lake surface area, allowing to compute CO_2 and CH_4 lacustrine emissions at the scale of the Amazon basin using the HydroLAKES spatial data set. The CO_2 and CH_4 emissions from highland lakes (elevation > 500 m) only represented 0.4% and 2% of the total lacustrine emissions at the scale of the Amazon basin, respectively. Total CO_2 and CH_4 emissions from lakes represented a small fraction (8.6%) of total lentic and lotic CO_2 and CH_4 emissions at the scale of the Amazon basin. The lake and river emissions of CH_4 represented ~ 3% of total CH_4 emissions from all compartments of the Amazon basin, mainly attributable to wetlands."

Using the recently derived Lorentz-covariant field spin operator, we obtain a corresponding field position operator through the total angular momentum formula. Acting on the Dirac spinor representation, the eigenvalues of the field position operator correspond to the spatial components of the Lorentz-covariant space-time coordinate $$\\textbf{4}$$ 4 -vector. We show that the field position operator preserves the particle and the antiparticle character of the states. Thus, the field position operator can serve as a one-particle position operator for both particles and antiparticles, thereby avoiding an unusual fast-oscillating term, known as the Zitterbewegung, associated with the Dirac position operator. We show that the field position operator yields the same velocity as a classical free particle. The eigenstates of the field position operator satisfy the Newton-Wigner locality criteria and transform in a Lorentz-covariant manner. The field position operator becomes particle position and antiparticle position operators when acting on the particle and the antiparticle subspaces, both of which are Hermitian. Additionally, we demonstrate that within the particle subspace of the Dirac spinor space, the field position operator is equivalent to the Newton-Wigner position operator."

        "abstract": "First-principles calculations, using density functional theory, have been studied to investigate the sensing of NO_2, NO, N_2, CO_2, CO, O_2, NH_3 and SO_2 gases on bare and Fe-doped antimonene armchair nanoribbons (Fe-doped ASbNRs). The sensing behaviors of these gases on bare and Fe-doped ASbNRs have been analyzed in terms of band structure, the density of states, adsorption energy, charge transfer, magnetic moments and I–V characteristics. We showed that doping the magnetic Fe atom increases the sensing ability of antimonene nanoribbon where the gas molecules are chemisorption on Fe-doped ASbNR. This chemisorption induces dramatic change in the adsorption energy and electronic structures, and injects magnetic moments into the nanoribbon system. The NO molecule depicts the tightest binding in the Fe-doped ASbNRs. Charge transfer analysis of adsorbates demonstrates that all gas molecules, except NO, NH_3 and CO are electron donors to nanoribbon. Transport properties of Fe-doped ASbNRs transistor, display desirable I–V characteristics and spin filter efficiency for the NO_2, N_2, and NH_3 gases. These two-dimensional systems may possess the potential in the promising application of gas sensing."

        "abstract": "The maximum excavation span of the large-span transition section of Badaling Great Wall station is 32.7 m, and the excavation section is as large as 494.4 m^2. It is rather difficult to ensure the stability of the surrounding rock during tunnel excavation, therefore, it is necessary to select appropriate construction methods. In the present study, three methods commonly used for excavating large-span tunnels including the three-bench seven-step excavation method, double side drift method, and sequential excavation method (SEM) were used in excavating the 30 m-level large-span tunnels and the results were compared. The principal stress distribution of the surrounding rock, arch settlement, and plastic zone range obtained for the three construction methods was compared using numerical calculation, thus determining the optimal construction method and proposing specific support measures. The feasibility of the construction method and the reliability of support settings were verified by monitoring the arch settlement and surrounding rock damage zone. The results from the numerical calculation and field monitoring were analyzed. The SEM was advantageous over the other two methods for the excavation of 30 m-level large-span tunnels. It is necessary to emphasize the excavation and support of the arch and the middle bench when the SEM is adopted. It was feasible to maximize the self-bearing capacity of the surrounding rock by establishing a multi-level support system with anchor cables and anchor bolts of different lengths. The study findings can provide a reference for excavating 30 m-level large-span tunnels."

We unravel that the phase sensitivity can be greatly enhanced with the cavity-mediated nonlinear interaction. The influence of encoding phase, splitting time and recombining time on phase sensitivity are carefully studied. In addition, we demonstrate a dynamical phase transition in the system. Around the criticality, a small cavity light field variation can arouse a strong response of the atomic condensate, which can serve as a new resource for enhanced sensing. This work provides a robust protocol for cavity-enhanced metrology."

Therefore, it is necessary to compare and analyze the similarities and differences of lightning overvoltage under different operation modes of AC and DC. In this paper, through the establishment of large span section transmission line electromagnetic transient simulation model, calculate the transmission line in the original AC insulation configuration, AC and DC operation mode of the difference between the large span section lightning overvoltage. The results show that the same insulation configuration of DC operation when the line is subject to lightning overvoltage value is greater than the overall AC mode of operation. When the lightning current is above 100 KA, the lightning current bypasses the transmission line, the DC line overvoltage is about 18.3% larger than the AC line overvoltage, bringing a hidden danger to the insulation configuration of the original AC line."

Due to the spin–orbit interaction, the effective mass of the polaron splits into two branches. The dependence of effective mass on temperature, electron–phonon coupling strength, transverse and longitudinal confinement lengths, and velocity is discussed by numerical calculation. The theoretical results indicate that the effective mass of the polaron is an increasing function of temperature and electron–phonon coupling strength, but a decreasing function of transverse confinement length, longitudinal confinement length, and velocity. The absolute value of spin splitting effective mass increases with the increase of temperature and spin–orbit coupling parameter, but decreases with the increase of transverse confinement length, longitudinal confinement length, and velocity. Due to the heavy hole characteristic, the spin splitting effective mass is negative."

In evaluating hydrodynamics forces acting on the pipe, the larger pipe diameter, longer pipe length and coarser pipe surface introduced higher hydrodynamic force on the pipe, in term of drag and lift forces. In term of the development of wake region at pipe aft, the smaller pipe diameter, shorter pipe length, and smoother pipe surface has smaller wake region size.

These methods measure the distances between spin labels yielding distance equations that are solved using numerical algorithms to provide one or several structural predictions. In this work, the minimum number of SDSL distance measurements and distance measurement types required to predict a unique nucleic acid structure were investigated. Our results indicate that at least six distance measurements should be obtained given that the distance measurements do not connect one SDSL on one arm with more than three SDSLs on the other arm. Moreover, there may be a preference for 1-to-1 SLs distance measurements rather than 1-to-many SLs as the latter was linked to undefined structures discussed in this study. Methods Pairs of double-helical arms of nucleic acid were simulated using the finite element software Pro/ENGINEER (PTC Inc., Boston, MA). In each simulation, a specific SDSL distance measurement plan was adopted and the resulting structure was tested for movability. Immovable structures indicate that this plan will potentially result in a unique structural prediction of the nucleic acid.

The effects of changing neighboring interaction and uniaxial crystal field anisotropy parameters on the obtained soliton and its amplitudes are explored. The changing values of neighboring interaction parameters are exhibited as an increase in wave height with increasing parametric values, but increasing the values of the uniaxial crystal field anisotropy parameter causes a reduction in wave height. In the mean time, we see that the real part of the same solution exhibits periodic oscillation while the effects of the parameters have the same increasing and decreasing effects.

On the other hand, MQS is a computational approach to compare the electronic density distributions in different molecular systems. In this order of ideas, the study aims to answer questions about electronic and structural differences caused by the spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling from the initial geometry [Steradians (SR) geometry] using the MQS framework. The MQS is based on the Molecular Quantum Similarity Measure (MQSM) using different positive operators such as Dirac delta and Coulomb operators to quantify the similarity between molecular systems. The paper presents tables with MQSM indices and Euclidean distances for different molecular clusters using initial geometry vs. geometry involved spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling. The scalar, spin–orbit and spin–spin relativistic coupling were incorporated using Amsterdam Density Functional code. The results show significant coupling of spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling on the similarity measures between different molecules. The manuscript suggests that understanding the relationship between spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling and quantum similarity could lead to deeper insights into electronic interactions in complex molecular systems and has potential applications in quantum mechanics and molecular physics."

Procedures SOX71 was synthesized by succinylation of the twelve alcohol groups of OX071 spin probe and characterized by EPR at X-Band (9.5 GHz) and at low field (720 MHz). The biocompatibility of SOX71 was tested in vitro and in vivo in mice. A pharmacokinetic study was performed to determine the best time frame for EPR imaging. Finally, a proof-of-concept EPR oxygen imaging was performed on a mouse model of a fibrosarcoma tumor. Results SOX71 was synthesized in one step from OX071. SOX71 exhibits a narrow line EPR spectrum with a peak-to-peak linewidth of 66 mG, similar to OX071. SOX71 does not bind to albumin nor show cell toxicity for the concentrations tested up to 5 mM. No toxicity was observed after systemic delivery via intraperitoneal injection in mice at twice the dose required for EPR imaging. After the injection, the probe is readily absorbed into the bloodstream, with a peak blood concentration half an hour, post-injection. Then, the probe is quickly cleared by the kidney with a half-life of ~ 45 min. SOX71 shows long relaxation times under anoxic condition (T_1e = 9.5 µs and T_2e = 5.1 µs; [SOX71] = 1 mM in PBS at 37 °C, p O_2 = 0 mmHg, 720 MHz). Both the relaxation rates R_1e and R_2e show a decreased sensitivity to p O_2, leading to twice longer relaxation times under room air conditions ( p O_2 = 159 mmHg) compared to OX071. This is ideal for oxygen imaging in samples with a wide range of p O_2. Both the relaxation rates R_1e and R_2e show a decreased sensitivity to self-relaxation compared to OX071, with a negligible effect of the probe concentration on R_1e. SOX71 was successfully applied to image oxygen in a tumor. Conclusion SOX71, a succinylated derivative of OX071 was synthesized, characterized, and applied for in vivo EPR tumor oxygen imaging. SOX71 is highly biocompatible, and shows decreased sensitivity to oxygen and self-relaxation.

Our goal is to develop low-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods to monitor radicals that contribute to the disease. Procedures Free radicals generated in a lipopolysaccharide-induced mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome reacted with cyclic hydroxylamines CPH (1-hydroxy-3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine hydrochloride) and DCP-AM-H (4-acetoxymethoxycarbonyl-1-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid), which were converted into the corresponding nitroxide radicals, CP• and DCP•. The EPR signals of the nitroxide radicals in excised lungs were imaged with a 1 GHz EPR spectrometer/imager that employs rapid scan technology. Results The small numbers of nitroxides formed by reaction of the hydroxylamine with superoxide result in low signal-to-noise in the spectra and images. However, since the spectral properties of the nitroxides are known, we can use prior knowledge of the line shape and hyperfine splitting to fit the noisy data, yielding well-defined spectra and images. Two-dimensional spectral-spatial images are shown for lung samples containing (4.5 ± 0.5) ×10^14 CP• and (9.9 ± 1.0) ×10^14 DCP• nitroxide spins. These results suggest that a probe that accumulates in cells gives a stronger nitroxide signal than a probe that is more easily washed out of cells.

Here, using non-equilibrium Green’s function combined with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT), we investigated the linear photogalvanic effect (LPGE) in monolayers of group-V elements (As, Sb, and Bi) by first-principles calculations. First, by designing a two-probe structure based on the group-V elements, we found a giant anisotropy photoresponse of As between the armchair and zigzag directions. Then, we analyzed Sb and Bi’s charge and spin photocurrent characteristics when considering the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. It is found that when the polarization direction of linearly polarized light is parallel or perpendicular to the transport direction ( θ = 0° or 90°), the spin up and spin down photoresponse in the armchair direction has the same magnitude and direction, leading to the generation of net charge current. However, in the zigzag direction, the spin up and spin down photoresponse have the same magnitude with opposite directions, leading to the generation of pure spin current. Furthermore, it is understood by analyzing the bulk spin photovoltaic (BSPV) coefficient from the symmetry point of view. Finally, we found that the net charge current generated in the armchair direction and the pure spin current generated in the zigzag direction can be further tuned with the increase of the material’s buckling height ∣ h ∣. Our results highlight that these group-V monolayers are promising candidates for novel functional materials, which will provide a broad prospect for the realization of ultra-thin ferroelectric devices in optoelectronics due to their spontaneous polarization characteristics and high Curie temperature."

Thylakoids were subjected to treatments aimed at poising the redox state of the terminal electron transfer acceptors and donors of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI), respectively. Under ambient redox conditions, four Chl d triplet populations were detectable, identifiable by their characteristic zero field splitting parameters, after deconvolution of the Fluorescence Detected Magnetic Resonance (FDMR) spectra. Illumination in the presence of the redox mediator N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) and sodium ascorbate at room temperature led to a redistribution of the triplet populations, with T_3 (| D |= 0.0245 cm^−1, | E |= 0.0042 cm^−1) becoming dominant and increasing in intensity with respect to untreated samples. A second triplet population (T_4, | D |= 0.0248 cm^−1, | E |= 0.0040 cm^−1) having an intensity ratio of about 1:4 with respect to T_3 was also detectable after illumination in the presence of TMPD and ascorbate. The microwave-induced Triplet-minus-Singlet spectrum acquired at the maximum of the |D|–|E| transition (610 MHz) displays a broad minimum at 740 nm, accompanied by a set of complex spectral features that overall resemble, despite showing further fine spectral structure, the previously reported Triplet-minus-Singlet spectrum attributed to the recombination triplet of PSI reaction centre, $${}^{3}P_{740}^{{}}$$ 3 P 740 [Schenderlein M, Çetin M, Barber J, et al. Spectroscopic studies of the chlorophyll d containing photosystem I from the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina . Biochim Biophys Acta 1777:1400–1408]. However, TR-EPR experiments indicate that this triplet displays an eaeaea electron spin polarisation pattern which is characteristic of triplet sublevels populated by intersystem crossing rather than recombination, for which an aeeaae polarisation pattern is expected instead. It is proposed that the observed triplet, which leads to the bleaching of the P _740 singlet state, sits on the PSI reaction centre."

        "abstract": "We numerically investigate magnon-mediated spin transport through nonmagnetic metal/ferromagnetic insulator (NM/FI) heterostructures in the presence of Anderson disorder, and discover universal behaviors of the spin conductance in both one-dimensional (1D) and 2D systems. In the localized regime, the variance of logarithmic spin conductance σ ^2(ln G _ T ) shows a universal linear scaling with its average 〈ln G _ T 〉, independent of Fermi energy, temperature, and system size in both 1D and 2D cases. In 2D, the competition between disorder-enhanced density of states at the NM/FI interface and disorder-suppressed spin transport leads to a non-monotonic dependence of average spin conductance on the disorder strength. As a result, in the metallic regime, average spin conductance is enhanced by disorder, and a new linear scaling between spin conductance fluctuation rms( G _ T ) and average spin conductance G _ T is revealed which is universal at large system width. These universal scaling behaviors suggest that spin transport mediated by magnon in disordered 2D NM/FI systems belongs to a new universality class, different from that of charge conductance in 2D normal metal systems."

        "abstract": "When an external parameter such as an electric field or an optical generation rate is changed as a function of time, carriers in the semiconductor respond on this disturbance by a redistribution controlled by relaxation times. Relaxation proceeds by elastic or inelastic scattering with carriers, phonons, defects, or spin momenta, and respective time constants range from femtoseconds to years. Relaxation of injected carriers is given by the carrier lifetime and related to their diffusion or drift length. Nonthermal excess energy of hot carriers is transferred to the lattice mostly by optical phonons. At high carrier density also plasmons, and at high carrier-generation rates and low lattice temperature, condensation into electron-hole droplets with evaporation into excitons are involved. Optical phonons, excited by fast carriers or by an IR light pulse, relax their momenta by elastic scattering with phonons in the same branch, or by a decay into acoustical phonons. Relaxation of excitons created by nonresonant optical excitation proceeds by inelastic scattering, eventually yielding radiative recombination for momenta near the zone center. The rise time in the luminescence after pulse excitation is controlled by the balance to uncorrelated electron-hole pairs. Resonantly excited excitons show a fast rise in the coherent regime and an exponential decay with an observed time constant depending on excitation density. Carrier spin and orbital momenta are coherently aligned by excitation with polarized light. The subsequent relaxation can be detected by the degree of polarization of the radiative recombination. Holes in semiconductors with degenerate valence bands at the zone center have short spin-relaxation times in the sub-ps range; lifting this degeneracy slows relaxation down. Electrons have usually longer spin-relaxation times, limited by various mechanisms. In an exciton with weak electron-hole interaction the spin-relaxation time of the sequential spin flip of electron and hole is given by the slower particle, while at stronger interaction the faster simultaneous spin flip occurs."

        "abstract": "Embedded machine learning (ML) systems have now become the dominant platform for deploying ML serving tasks and are projected to become of equal importance for training ML models. With this comes the challenge of overall efficient deployment, in particular low-power and high-throughput implementations, under stringent memory constraints. In this context, non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) and spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) have significant advantages compared to conventional SRAM due to their non-volatility, higher cell density, and scalability features. While prior work has investigated several architectural implications of NVM for generic applications, in this chapter, we present DeepNVM++ , a comprehensive framework to characterize, model, and analyze NVM-based caches in GPU architectures for deep learning (DL) applications by combining technology-specific circuit-level models and the actual memory behavior of various DL workloads. DeepNVM++ relies on iso-capacity and iso-area performance and energy models for last-level caches implemented using conventional SRAM and emerging STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM technologies. In the iso-capacity case, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 3.8 × and 4.7 × energy-delay product (EDP) reduction and 2.4 × and 2.8 × area reduction compared to conventional SRAM, respectively. Under iso-area assumptions, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 2.2 × and 2.4 × EDP reduction and accommodate 2.3 × and 3.3 × cache capacity when compared to SRAM, respectively. We also perform a scalability analysis and show that STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM achieve orders of magnitude EDP reduction when compared to SRAM for large cache capacities. DeepNVM++ is demonstrated on STT-/SOT-MRAM technologies and can be used for the characterization, modeling, and analysis of any NVM technology for last-level caches in GPUs for DL applications."

        "abstract": "Time scales in Celestial Mechanics and Astrodynamics vary considerably, from a few hours for the motion of Earth’s artificial satellites to millions of years for planetary dynamics. Hence, the time scales on which one needs to investigate the stability of celestial objects are different. Therefore, the methods of study are themselves different and might lead to specific definitions of stability, either in the sense of bounds on the initial conditions or rather in the sense of confinement in a given region of the phase space. In this work we concentrate on three different methods: perturbation theory, Nekhoroshev’s theorem, KAM theory. All theories are constructive in the sense that they provide explicit algorithms to give estimates on the parameters of the system and on the stability time. Perturbation theory gives results on finite time scales, Nekhoroshev’s theorem provides stability results on exponentially long times, KAM theory ensures the confinement between invariant tori in low-dimensional systems. We recall the basic ingredients of each theory, starting with KAM theory, then presenting Nekhoroshev’s theorem and finally introducing perturbation theory. We provide examples of stability results for some objects of the Solar system. Precisely, we consider the stability of the rotational motion of the Moon (or other planetary satellites) within the spin-orbit model by means of KAM theory, we analyze the stability of asteroids, also in the triangular equilibrium Lagrangian points, using Nekhoroshev’s theorem, we study the Earth’s satellite dynamics through perturbation theory."

        "abstract": "We present our findings on how orange peel coupling (OPC) between the ferromagnetic layers affects spin transfer torque-assisted magnetization reversal dynamics in CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO pentalayer nanopillar devices. We accomplish this by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation (dynamical equation) using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order numerical technique. To begin, we examine the influence of OPC on switching times by simulating the LLGS equation separately for each pentalayer device, both with and without OPC. The magnetization switching times for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices in the absence of OPC are 58 ps , 82 ps , and 154 ps , respectively. When introducing OPC in the pentalayer alloys, we observe a reduction in switching times of 3.5%, 11%, and 40% for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices, respectively. Furthermore, we calculate the current density required to reverse the magnetization of the free layer in CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO pentalayer devices, which is found to be $$0.78\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 0.78 × 10 12 A / m 2 , $$1.8\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 1.8 × 10 12 A / m 2 , and $$4.4\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 4.4 × 10 12 A / m 2 , respectively. In addition, we investigate how the thicknesses of the free and spacer layers, as well as the wavelength and amplitude of interface roughness, affect the magnetization switching time. Understanding the effects of OPC paves the way for the practical implementation of spin transfer torque (STT)-based memory devices."

Mn_2TiSi Heusler alloy was synthesized by a conventional vacuum arc remelting process. The formation of Heusler phase along with the secondary phases was observed after annealing it at 773 K for 120 h. The X-ray diffraction pattern illustrates the presence of cubic B2 disordered phase along with a secondary phase with a lattice parameter of 5.82 Å. The microstructure and compositional analysis of Mn_2TiSi alloy shows the presence of distribution of Mn, Ti, and Si elements according to their stoichiometric ratio. The magnetic measurements show a ferromagnetic nature with Curie temperature ( T _C) around 203 K. With low magnetic moment and coercivity, Mn_2TiSi can be used for switching applications because of its fast magnetization reversal. So, Mn_2TiSi becomes the greatest choice for use in spintronics due to its low magnetic moment and low coercivity."

Non-volatile memories play an essential role in transforming the semiconductor industry for future use. This paper aims to describe characteristics of different types of non-volatile memories, ‘available’ and ‘emerging’, in the semiconductor industry.

In addition, characteristics of different emerging memories such as all-optical switching MTJ, ReRAM, PCM, SOT-MRAM, STT-MRAM, etc. have been discussed on basis of various performance parameters.

In this technique, a weak probe laser beam is applied in the presence of a strong control laser beam, which creates a transparency window in the medium, allowing the probe beam to pass through with minimal absorption. By controlling the relative phase and polarization of the probe and control beams, the angular momentum of the probe beam can be manipulated and controlled coherently. Substantial variation is investigated in the behavior of the graphs of two interfering waves with the Rabi frequencies of the control field, detuning of the probe and control fields and the angle between the two interfering waves. Magnetic spin vector field distribution and magnetic spin density of circularly, diagonally and linearly polarized probe light field are coherently controlled and modified. The major role in this modification is played by the detuning of the probe field and the parameters of the control fields. This modified work in magnetic spin density and magnetic spin AM vector field arrow distribution is useful in the unidirectional optical interfaces, birefringence and the quantum spin Hall effect of the light beam."

Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is an emerging nonvolatile memory used for recording and reproducing the digital information. Earlier studies on RRAM applications suggest that spinel ferrite is a potential material. We envisage that the spinel ferrite prepared by a particular route, namely spin coating, will in future optimize the essential parameters for optimal functioning of RRAM. An assertion to our assumptions, few researchers have already obtained important findings for spin coated spinel ferrites. Spin coated spinel ferrites, namely zinc ferrite, nickel ferrite, cobalt ferrite and mixed spinel ferrites, have been investigated for their applications as switching layers in RRAM devices. Particularly, spin coated cobalt ferrite, nickel ferrite and doped nickel ferrite were widely used as resistive switching layers. However, it is noticed that there is a tremendous scope for synthesis and resistive switching characterization of spin coated pure and doped zinc ferrite. Proper doping of special element into spinel ferrite can enhance the resistive switching performance of RRAM devices. Insertion of nano structures and metal layers within switching layer uplifts the performance of spin coated spinel ferrite-based RRAM devices. Active layer in RRAM device synthesized by spin coating technique exhibited good resistive switching properties, namely retention of $$10^{3}$$ 10 3 to $$10^{5}$$ 10 5 s, endurance in the range of $$10^{2}$$ 10 2 to 22,500 cycles and memory window of $$10^{2}$$ 10 2 to $$10^{6}$$ 10 6 .

A unified rolling contact tribology analytical model is proposed for dry-lubricated angular contact ball bearings (ACBBs) considering the extreme conditions including high combined loads and rolling contact effects. A comprehensive solution framework is proposed to ensure the robustness of the model under different loading conditions. Equilibrium equations are solved to study the effects of friction coefficients, rotating speeds, and combined loads on the skidding and spinning characteristics of the ACBB. The results show that the rolling contact effects and combined loads significantly affect the skidding and spinning performance of the ACBB. Further analysis reveals that the skidding mechanism is related to the interaction between ball kinematical motion and traction forces. The developed analytical model is proved to more accurately predict the bearing kinematical and tribological behavior as it discards the raceway control hypothesis and considers the macro/micro-slipping, creepage, and self-spinning motions of the ball, which is validated using both the existing pure axial loading dry-lubricated ACBB model and the classical Jones—Harris model.

The transition among asymmetric characteristics (i.e., molecular chirality, photonic polarization and electronic spin) is proposed as a universal methodology to realize the detection, control and synthesis of chirality. Exploring the origin of symmetry breaking contributes to the development of a general reliable strategy for asymmetric synthesis. Chirality, as the symmetric breaking of molecules, plays an essential role in physical, chemical and especially biological processes, which highlights the accurate distinction among heterochiralities as well as the precise preparation for homochirality. To this end, the well-designed structure-specific recognizer and catalysis reactor are necessitated, respectively. However, each kind of target molecules requires a custom-made chiral partner and the dynamic disorder of spatial-orientation distribution of molecules at the ensemble level leads to an inefficient protocol. In this perspective article, we developed a universal strategy capable of realizing the chirality detection and control by the external symmetry breaking based on the alignment of the molecular frame to external stimuli. Specifically, in combination with the discussion about the relationship among the chirality (molecule), spin (electron) and polarization (photon), i.e., the three natural symmetry breaking, single-molecule junctions were proposed to achieve a single-molecule/event-resolved detection and synthesis. The fixation of the molecular orientation and the CMOS-compatibility provide an efficient interface to achieve the external input of symmetry breaking. This perspective is believed to offer more efficient applications in accurate chirality detection and precise asymmetric synthesis via the close collaboration of chemists, physicists, materials scientists, and engineers."

Therefore, the greatest challenge of modern societies is to ensure that the increase in lifespan is accompanied by an increase in health span. To better understand the differences in human lifespan, new insight concerning the relationship between lifespan and the age of onset of diseases, and the ability to avoid them is needed. We aimed to comprehensively study, at a population-wide level, the sex-specific disease patterns associated with human lifespan. Methods Observational data from the SIDIAP database of a cohort of 482,058 individuals that died in Catalonia (Spain) at ages over 50 years old between the 1st of January 2006 and the 30th of June 2022 were included. The time to the onset of the first disease in multiple organ systems, the prevalence of escapers, the percentage of life free of disease, and their relationship with lifespan were evaluated considering sex-specific traits. Results In the study cohort, 50.4% of the participants were women and the mean lifespan was 83 years. The results show novel relationships between the age of onset of disease, health span, and lifespan. The key findings include: Firstly, the onset of both single and multisystem diseases is progressively delayed as lifespan increases. Secondly, the prevalence of escapers is lower in lifespans around life expectancy. Thirdly, the number of disease-free systems decreases until individuals reach lifespans around 87–88 years old, at which point it starts to increase. Furthermore, long-lived women are less susceptible to multisystem diseases. The associations between health span and lifespan are system-dependent, and disease onset and the percentage of life spent free of disease at the time of death contribute to explaining lifespan variability. Lastly, the study highlights significant system-specific disparities between women and men. Conclusions Health interventions focused on delaying aging and age-related diseases should be the most effective in increasing not only lifespan but also health span. The findings of this research highlight the relevance of Electronic Health Records in studying the aging process and open up new possibilities in age-related disease prevention that should assist primary care professionals in devising individualized care and treatment plans."

Nonlinear dynamic behavior of the spinning beam-disk and its boundary supporting system are described based on energy principle, and the system governing equations of spinning beam-disk are formulated by the Lagrange equation of the second type. The time-domain response is then obtained by solving the system dynamic equations through Runge–Kutta method, while the reliability of the current model is verified through the comparison with those predicted by harmonic balance method. Then, the effect of sweep direction and nonlinear elastic boundary parameters on system dynamic behavior of the spinning Timoshenko beam-disk is investigated and addressed. The results show that the dynamic responses of the spinning beam-disk with nonlinear elastic boundary are sensitive to the initial values of calculation, and the nonlinear elastic boundary parameters make the spinning beam-disk exhibit complex dynamic behavior.

The sensing behaviors of these gases on bare and Fe-doped ASbNRs have been analyzed in terms of band structure, the density of states, adsorption energy, charge transfer, magnetic moments and I–V characteristics. We showed that doping the magnetic Fe atom increases the sensing ability of antimonene nanoribbon where the gas molecules are chemisorption on Fe-doped ASbNR. This chemisorption induces dramatic change in the adsorption energy and electronic structures, and injects magnetic moments into the nanoribbon system.

        "abstract": "The infinite spin chains in tetramethylammonium manganese chloride (TMMC) (chemical formula: $$\\mathrm {(CH_{3})_{4}NMnCl_{3}}$$ ( CH 3 ) 4 NMnCl 3 ) have long been thought to be the best example of a one-dimensional antiferromagnet with nearest-neighbor (NN) Heisenberg exchange interaction. The present work continues the study of magnetization steps (MSTs) from the infinite spin chains in Cd-diluted TMMC (chemical formula: $$\\mathrm {(CH_{3})_{4}NMn_{\\textit{x}}Cd_{1-\\textit{x}}Cl_{3}}$$ ( CH 3 ) 4 NMn x Cd 1 - x Cl 3 ). MSTs from a sample with x = 0.50 were studied in magnetic fields up to 17 T. These MSTs originated from chains with the following numbers of NN spins: n = 2, 4, 6 and 8. An earlier study of MSTs from samples with 0.16 $$\\le$$ ≤ x $$\\le$$ ≤ 0.50 was carried out at T = 0.55 K. In that earlier lower-resolution study, the observed MSTs were from chains with n = 2 and 4. The 0.55 K data seemed to agree with the isotropic NN Heisenberg (INNH) model, which includes only the NN Heisenberg exchange and the Zeeman energy. The present higher-resolution data at 20 mK show clear discrepancies with this model, indicating that some weak interactions that are not included in the INNH model are not insignificant. Discrepancies with the INNH model in magnetic fields B $$\\approx$$ ≈ 1 T are attributed to the dipole-dipole anisotropy. Of greater significance are discrepancies in the ratios of the magnetic field at different MSTs. These discrepancies are observed above 2 T. The discrepancies in the field ratios imply that the energies of the short spin chains deviate from those calculated from the INNH model. Similar deviations were noted a few earlier studies of spin clusters in other materials. In these earlier studies the deviations were attributed to biquadratic exchange. Although the known properties of Cd-diluted TMMC are consistent with the requirements for a significant biquadratic exchange, the present data are insufficient for concluding that biquadratic exchange is definitively the cause of the observed discrepancies in the field ratios."

        "abstract": "The development of hydrogen charging stations is continuously progressing and is focusing on hydrogen pressure vessels (type 1), which are one of the components of a hydrogen filling station. The dome part of a hydrogen pressure vessel is formed by a spinning process using a pipe that is manufactured by a hot forging method. For thick pipes, there is a problem with non-uniform formation of the dome part. Since this problem causes the boss part not to form, it is difficult to obtain the desired thickness of the boss part for attaching a valve, which may affect the structural safety of the dome part. In this study, a finite element analysis (FEA) model of the spinning process was established for a thick pipe, and the validity of the analysis was compared with the result of the actual process. Furthermore, the causes of forming defects during the spinning process were reviewed through FEA by applying various design parameters. Based on the results, design factors were selected to control the forming defects in the spinning process, and a spinning process was designed to minimize the thickness change of the dome part."

        "abstract": "Background and purpose Currently, the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab (BVZ) is used as a treatment option for high-grade glioma (HGG) patients. However, BVZ restores disruptions of the blood–brain barrier, which leads to the disappearance of contrast enhancement during radiological examinations and therefore complicates evaluations of treatment efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the radio-morphological features of recurrent lesions that newly appeared under BVZ therapy, as well as the utility of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging for evaluating treatment response and prognosis in HGG patients receiving BVZ. Methods Thirty-two patients (20 males, 12 females; age range, 35–84 years) with HGG who experienced a recurrence under BVZ therapy were enrolled. We measured the relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) values of each recurrent lesion using ASL, and retrospectively investigated the correlation between rCBF values and prognosis. Results The optimal rCBF cut-off value for predicting prognosis was defined as 1.67 using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The patients in the rCBF < 1.67 group had significantly longer overall survival (OS) and post-progression survival (PPS) than those in the rCBF ≥ 1.67 group (OS: 34.0 months vs. 13.0 months, p  = 0.03 and PPS: 13.0 months vs. 6.0 months, p  < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion The ASL-derived rCBF values of recurrent lesions may serve as an effective imaging biomarker for prognosis in HGG patients undergoing BVZ therapy. Low rCBF values may indicate that BVZ efficacy is sustainable, which will influence BVZ treatment strategies in HGG patients."

DeepNVM++ relies on iso-capacity and iso-area performance and energy models for last-level caches implemented using conventional SRAM and emerging STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM technologies. In the iso-capacity case, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 3.8 × and 4.7 × energy-delay product (EDP) reduction and 2.4 × and 2.8 × area reduction compared to conventional SRAM, respectively. Under iso-area assumptions, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 2.2 × and 2.4 × EDP reduction and accommodate 2.3 × and 3.3 × cache capacity when compared to SRAM, respectively. We also perform a scalability analysis and show that STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM achieve orders of magnitude EDP reduction when compared to SRAM for large cache capacities. DeepNVM++ is demonstrated on STT-/SOT-MRAM technologies and can be used for the characterization, modeling, and analysis of any NVM technology for last-level caches in GPUs for DL applications."

        "abstract": "The application of forming operations instead of conventional cutting processes is a practical approach to increase material efficiency and functional integration, thus addressing lightweight design. In this context, the innovative process class of Sheet-Bulk Metal Forming is presented, which combines the advantage of bulk and sheet metal forming. One of the assigned processes for the manufacturing of functional components with different form elements is orbital forming. Within previous investigations, the major challenge could be identified as a control of the material flow. Since process parameters, like an increased forming force, are not sufficient to avoid process failures in form of wrinkles, other measures have to be taken into account. Especially when applying precipitation hardenable aluminum alloys, one possibility is the application of a local short-term heat treatment. By locally reversing the hardening effect of the precipitation clusters, the interaction between softened and still hard areas can be used to attain the desired material flow. Although this procedure is established for conventional sheet metal forming processes and was furthermore investigated for the orbital forming of components from the aluminum alloy EN AW-6016, the influence on the forming of high-strength aluminum from the 7xxx-series is still content of current research. Especially due to a reduced formability at room temperature, this alloy is predominantly formed at elevated temperatures. By introducing the established method of a local short-term heat treatment on 7xxx alloys, a contribution towards a possible forming at room temperature is made. Therefore, this work focuses on the development of a tailored heat treatment strategy to control the material flow during orbital forming. Specimens out of the high-strength aluminum alloy EN AW-7075 with a thickness of 2.0 mm in condition T6 are heat-treated and consequently cold formed. The results are quantified by a geometry-based analysis. The resulting strain distribution is used to verify the material flow proportions."

Beams carrying OAM have a helical phase front and a field strength with a singularity along the axial center, which can be used for information transmission, imaging, and particle manipulation. The number of orthogonal OAM modes in a single beam is theoretically infinite, and each mode is an element of a complete orthogonal basis that can be employed for multiplexing different signals, thus greatly improving the spectrum efficiency. In this chapter, we comprehensively summarize and compare the methods for generation and detection of optical OAM, radio OAM, and acoustic OAM. Then, we represent the applications and technical challenges of OAM in communications, including free-space optical communications, optical fiber communications, radio communications, and acoustic communications.

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of aerospace science and technology, and the orbital game technology has shown great potential value in the field of failed satellite maintenance, debris removal, etc. In this case, orbital game is often characterized by nonlinear dynamic model, unknown state information, high randomness, but the existing approaches to deal with game problem are difficult to be applied. The analytical method based on game theory is only applicable to simple scenarios, and it is challenging to find the optimal strategy for such complex scenarios as satellite swarm game. It should be noted that deep reinforcement learning has some research basis in the cooperative decision-making and control of multi-agents. In view of its powerful perception and decision ability, this paper applies deep reinforcement learning to solve the orbital game problem of satellite swarm. Firstly, the game scenario is modeled, where typical constraints, e.g., minimum time, optimal fuel, and collision avoidance, are taken into consideration in the game process, and then the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to solve the optimal maneuver strategy. The algorithm is based on the Actor-Critic architecture and uses a centralized training and decentralized execution approach to solve the optimal joint maneuver strategy. For different task scenarios, the action space, state observation space, and reward space are designed to introduce more rewards that match the specific game tasks to make the algorithm converge quickly, so that the satellite swarm emerges and executes better intelligent strategies to complete the corresponding game task."

Therefore, it is essential to create population-specific values to maximize the accuracy rate of sex estimation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the orbital region morphometrically for sex determination in a Saudi Arabian population using CT scan images. This study included 456 CT images (228 males and 228 females; age range, 18–58 years). Six orbital measurements and the orbital index of both sides were evaluated to determine sexual dimorphism and laterality using an independent t -test. Sex was estimated using discriminant function analysis. Based on the orbital index, the orbit was classified into megasemes, mesosemes, and microsemes. All the measurements were significantly greater in males than females, but the orbital index showed no significant sexual dimorphism. No significant asymmetry was found in all orbital dimensions. The univariate discriminant function of the orbital measurements showed an accuracy rate between 83.8 and 70%. The multivariate analysis classified the orbital dimensions into male (93%) and female (92.1%) to the highest level of accuracy. In Saudis, the megaseme category was the most prevalent form of orbit. The right orbit height (83.8%), left orbit height (80.7%), right orbit width (79.4%), and left orbit height (79.4%) were the most reliable variables that could be used in sex determination. According to multivariate analysis, the overall accuracy rate for determining sex was 92.1%. While the present study data may not be used alone for sexing a complete skull, there must be various occasions in which this new standard will contribute to determining sex in forensic contexts."

In the present study, expression pattern of receptor tyrosine kinases and its clinical significance in orbital RMS has been explored. Eighteen patients with histopathologically confirmed orbital RMS formed part of this study. Comprehensive q-PCR gene expression profiles of 19 RTKs were generated in the cases and controls. The patients were followed up for 59.53 ± 20.93 years. Clustering and statistical analysis tools were applied to identify the significant combination of RTKs associated with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma patients. mRNA overexpression of RTKs which included MET, AXL, EGFR was seen in 60–80% of cases; EGFR3, IGFR2, FGFR1, RET, PDGFR1, VEGFR2, PDGFR2 in 30–60% of cases; and EGFR4, FGFR3,VEGFR3 and ROS,IGFR1, EGFR1, FGFR2, VEGFR1 in 10–30% of cases. Immunoexpression of MET was seen in 89% of cases. A significant association was seen between MET mRNA and its protein expression. In all the cases MET gene expression was associated with worst overall survival ( P  = 0.03).There was a significant correlation of MET mRNA expression with RET, ROS, AXL, FGFR1, FGFR3, PDGFR1, IGFR1, VEGFR2, and EGFR3 genes. Association between MET gene and collective expression of RTKs was further evaluated by semi-supervised gene cluster analysis and Principal component analysis, which showed well-separated tumor clusters. MET gene overexpression could be a useful biomarker for identifying high risk orbital rhabdomyosarcoma patients. Well-separated tumor clusters confirmed the association between MET gene and collective expression of RTK genes. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of multi-kinase inhibitors targeting MET and the 9 other significant RTKs needs to be explored."

SBDD aims to offer a computational replacement to traditional high-throughput screening (HTS) methods of drug discovery. This “virtual screening” technique utilizes the structural data of a target protein in conjunction with large databases of potential drug candidates and then applies a range of different computational techniques to determine which potential candidates are likely to bind with high affinity and efficacy. It is proposed that high-throughput SBDD (HT-SBDD) will significantly enrich the success rate of HTS methods, which currently fluctuates around ~1%. In this chapter, we focus on the theory and utility of high-throughput drug docking, fragment molecular orbital calculations, and molecular dynamics techniques. We also offer a comparative review of the benefits and limitations of traditional methods against more recent SBDD advances.

When the off-axis vortex parameters were not equalled to the intensity distribution parameters, the analytical expression for the propagation of the OavGB in SNNM was obtained by using the ABCD matrix method. The expression for the second-order moment beamwidth and the trajectory equation for the center of the beam’s mass were obtained by analytical method. According to numerical simulations, the projection of the mass’s center on the cross-section was found to be an ellipse, a line segment, or a circle, with the direction of rotation of the projected trajectory around the z-axis depending on the direction of the orbital angular momentum, and the direction of rotation of the beam depending on the sign in front of the imaginary part of the vortex point. The direction of the OavGB’s rotation and the direction of revolution of the mass’s center may be the same or opposite, But the rotation period of the beam and the revolution period of the mass’s center were equated. The projected trajectory of the mass’s center of the beam on the cross-section can be controlled by the magnitude of the parameters a , b , c , d , $$\\zeta$$ ζ , f .

        "abstract": "Time scales in Celestial Mechanics and Astrodynamics vary considerably, from a few hours for the motion of Earth’s artificial satellites to millions of years for planetary dynamics. Hence, the time scales on which one needs to investigate the stability of celestial objects are different. Therefore, the methods of study are themselves different and might lead to specific definitions of stability, either in the sense of bounds on the initial conditions or rather in the sense of confinement in a given region of the phase space. In this work we concentrate on three different methods: perturbation theory, Nekhoroshev’s theorem, KAM theory. All theories are constructive in the sense that they provide explicit algorithms to give estimates on the parameters of the system and on the stability time. Perturbation theory gives results on finite time scales, Nekhoroshev’s theorem provides stability results on exponentially long times, KAM theory ensures the confinement between invariant tori in low-dimensional systems. We recall the basic ingredients of each theory, starting with KAM theory, then presenting Nekhoroshev’s theorem and finally introducing perturbation theory. We provide examples of stability results for some objects of the Solar system. Precisely, we consider the stability of the rotational motion of the Moon (or other planetary satellites) within the spin-orbit model by means of KAM theory, we analyze the stability of asteroids, also in the triangular equilibrium Lagrangian points, using Nekhoroshev’s theorem, we study the Earth’s satellite dynamics through perturbation theory."

Non-volatile memories play an essential role in transforming the semiconductor industry for future use. This paper aims to describe characteristics of different types of non-volatile memories, ‘available’ and ‘emerging’, in the semiconductor industry. Some recent developments are covered as a part of study in the application of all-optical-enabled MTJ, spin-polarized currents, phase conversion and magnetism in the logic and memory domain. In addition, characteristics of different emerging memories such as all-optical switching MTJ, ReRAM, PCM, SOT-MRAM, STT-MRAM, etc. have been discussed on basis of various performance parameters. Non-volatile memories mentioned above not only provides retention period of over 10 years but also ensures endurance over ~ 10^10 cycles.

        "abstract": "We consider a Celestial Mechanics model: the spin–orbit problem with a dissipative tidal torque, which is a singular perturbation of a conservative system. The goal of this paper is to show that it is possible to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the computation of quasi-periodic attractors for parameter values extremely close to the breakdown and, therefore, it is possible to obtain information on the breakdown mechanism of these quasi-periodic attractors. The method uses at the same time numerical and rigorous improvements to provide (i) a very accurate computation of the time-1 map of the spin–orbit problem (which reduces the dimensionality of the problem); (ii) a very efficient KAM method for maps which computes the attractor and its tangent spaces (by quadratically convergent, low storage requirements, and low operation count); (iii) explicit algorithms backed by a rigorous a posteriori KAM theorem, which establishes that if the algorithm is successful and produces a small residual, then there is a true solution nearby; and (iv) guaranteed algorithms to reach arbitrarily close to the border of existence as long as there are enough computer resources. As a by-product of the accuracy that we maintain till breakdown, we study several scale-invariant observables of the tori used in the renormalization group of infinite-dimensional spaces. In contrast with previously studied simple models, the behavior at breakdown of the spin–orbit problem does not satisfy standard scaling relations which implies that the spin–orbit problem is not described by a hyperbolic fixed point of the renormalization operator."

        "abstract": "Recent developments in the field of topological quantum materials have stimulated the search for materials that could serve as the building blocks for next-generation memory applications. Due to their intriguing topological properties, such as flat bands, Dirac nodes, and Weyl points, kagome magnets are anticipated to be the leading materials for this application. In this mini review, we discuss some of the recent advancements in binary kagome magnets, both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic, for use as emerging memory devices. First, we discuss ferromagnetic kagome magnets, specifically Fe $$_3$$ 3 Sn $$_2$$ 2 , and then we discuss non-collinear antiferromagnetic kagome magnets, Mn $$_3$$ 3 Sn and Mn $$_3$$ 3 Ir. Finally, we discuss collinear antiferromagnetic kagome magnet, FeSn. In each of the aforementioned sections, we begin with a discussion of their topological, structural, and magnetic properties, followed by application-specific studies such as spin-orbit torques (SOT). In the final section, we discuss the current state of kagome magnets for efficient, faster, denser, and reliable memory technologies with focus on the SOT switching and observation/manipulation of skyrmions."

        "abstract": "High-speed and low-power area-efficient memory solutions are in high demand in today’s smart and internet environment. To program and store data and its associated information, it has grown as a fantastic concept to replace charge in semiconductor devices with electron spin. By further eliminating power dissipation, this leads to the development of “green electronics,” a field of technology that is both energy and chip space efficient. A sort of spintronic device created for potential energy-efficient applications is the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device controlled by spin orbit torques (SOTs). A three-terminal MTJ device with perpendicular to the plane magnetization may operate more quickly and efficiently thanks to the available spin orbit torques (PMTJ). The design of a novel modified non-volatile master slave flip flop (NVMSFF) for register memory array architectures is presented in this study. It is low-power, high-speed, and area-efficient. The NVMSFF design uses a hybrid approach that combines CMOS 45 nm technology with a Verilog-A Model-based SOT-PMTJ circuit that uses spintronics. Additionally, the planned NVMSFF and current NVSFF were used in the design of the 4 × 4 and 8 × 8 memory arrays. The suggested updated NVMSFF was shown to have a lower latency, use less space, and dissipate less power. Additionally, it was discovered that Designed Memory arrays were space and energy efficient."

The theory can be used to describe the spin Hall effect and the anomalous Hall effect and can serve as a basis for describing the phenomena of spin-orbitronics. Phenomenological boundary conditions for the charge and spin fluxes at the interface between two different metals have been formulated, on the basis of which the injection of a pure spin current into a helimagnet, which arises in a normal metal as a manifestation of the spin Hall effect, is described. The existence of an “effect of chiral polarization of a pure spin current” is predicted, which consists in the appearance in a helimagnet of a longitudinally polarized pure spin current and a longitudinal component of the nonequilibrium electron magnetization, depending on the chirality of the helimagnet helix, upon injection of a transversely polarized spin current from a normal metal."

Interest in one-, two-, and three-dimensional magnetic structures is driven not only by the range of new properties and effects that require further theoretical and experimental studies, but also by the potential for their applications in practice.

We study spin pumping due to ferromagnetic resonance in permalloy ferromagnet—topological insulator bismuth selenide (Bi $$_2$$ 2 Se $$_3$$ 3 ) bilayers. We study cases of both uniform and nanostructured bilayers, where the permalloy layer is in the form of an array of nanocylinders with industry-relevant geometries. We measure the dc voltage signal caused by conversion of the spin current into the charge current in the bulk of topological insulator due to the inverse spin Hall effect. Our results show that the pumped signal for uniform and nanostructured bilayers is comparable, which is important for prospective applications in information and communication technologies. We report the temperature dependencies of a resonance magnetic field for the uniform sample. To obtain theoretical insight into the experimental results, we use a method which involves micromagnetic modeling for estimation of effective constants and dc voltages in experiments with similar nanostructured bilayers."

In this investigation, we demonstrate a tunable Rashba spin–orbit field at the LAO/STO interface via the application of an external gate electric field. The strength of the Rashba field was indirectly estimated by measuring the planar angle dependence of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). The asymmetry of the planar AMR between θ  = 0 and π indicates the existence of Rashba spin–orbit fields, which are tunable by adjusting the current density and gate electric field. From the AMR measurements, the effective Rashba field exhibits up to 4 T for the application of an external back-gate voltage of 30 V. This controllable and relatively high Rashba field suggests that the LAO/STO is an attractive 2-D interface for potential spin–orbitronic applications, such as spin-charge converters, spin-FETs, and spin–orbit torque devices."

In this work, new dilute magnetic semiconductor compositions and broad spectrum photocatalysts based on Gd doped and (Gd, Mn) codoped CuO were synthesized by adapted sol gel method. The analyzed XRD peaks were completely indexed to the crystallographic planes of monoclinic copper oxide (CuO) structure. The effectual substitution of Cu^2+-sites by Gd and (Gd, Mn) ions was verified from the expansion of the unit cell and shift of the XRD peaks. The inclusion of Gd and (Gd, Mn) ions move the band gap energy of pure CuO (1.41 eV, λ = 879 nm) to low energy region with measured values of 1.3 eV (λ = 953 nm) and 1.26 eV (λ = 984 nm), respectively. The morphological analysis illustrates that the existence of Gd and Mn ions enhances the reduction of the grains size of CuO with more distribution of fine particles. The room temperature ferromagnetic order was impressively improved after incorporation of (Gd, Mn) ions into the lattice of CuO.

The calculated cohesive energies indicated that the zigzag-edges (ZZ) configuration was the most stable. The electronic band structures of the three configurations were calculated with and without the uniaxial strain. The results showed that the beard-shaped edges (BB) geometry had a direct band gap, whereas the zigzag–beard-shaped edges (ZB) and ZZ configurations had indirect band gaps. The effect of edge passivation with Cl atoms on the electronic properties of PGNRs have been investigated. When transition metals (TMs) were adsorbed at the edge of the nanoribbons, the adsorption energy was the lowest for the BB and ZZ configurations. The BB and ZZ configurations also exhibited magnetic semiconducting behavior in the presence of Mn, Fe, and Co atoms at the edge. Finally, we studied the spin-flip gap and spin stiffness for the BB and ZZ configurations. These results suggest that PGNRs with edge adsorption of transition metals could be important for spintronic devices, quantum computing, and other applications. In addition, we provide theoretical guidance for regulating the properties of PGNRs by applying strain, edge modifications, and the adsorption of transition metals. We believe that our work will be useful in the design and development of new PGNR-based devices. Graphical Abstract "

With this comes the challenge of overall efficient deployment, in particular low-power and high-throughput implementations, under stringent memory constraints. In this context, non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) and spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) have significant advantages compared to conventional SRAM due to their non-volatility, higher cell density, and scalability features. While prior work has investigated several architectural implications of NVM for generic applications, in this chapter, we present DeepNVM++ , a comprehensive framework to characterize, model, and analyze NVM-based caches in GPU architectures for deep learning (DL) applications by combining technology-specific circuit-level models and the actual memory behavior of various DL workloads. DeepNVM++ relies on iso-capacity and iso-area performance and energy models for last-level caches implemented using conventional SRAM and emerging STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM technologies. In the iso-capacity case, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 3.8 × and 4.7 × energy-delay product (EDP) reduction and 2.4 × and 2.8 × area reduction compared to conventional SRAM, respectively. Under iso-area assumptions, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 2.2 × and 2.4 × EDP reduction and accommodate 2.3 × and 3.3 × cache capacity when compared to SRAM, respectively. We also perform a scalability analysis and show that STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM achieve orders of magnitude EDP reduction when compared to SRAM for large cache capacities.

Hence, the time scales on which one needs to investigate the stability of celestial objects are different. Therefore, the methods of study are themselves different and might lead to specific definitions of stability, either in the sense of bounds on the initial conditions or rather in the sense of confinement in a given region of the phase space. In this work we concentrate on three different methods: perturbation theory, Nekhoroshev’s theorem, KAM theory. All theories are constructive in the sense that they provide explicit algorithms to give estimates on the parameters of the system and on the stability time. Perturbation theory gives results on finite time scales, Nekhoroshev’s theorem provides stability results on exponentially long times, KAM theory ensures the confinement between invariant tori in low-dimensional systems. We recall the basic ingredients of each theory, starting with KAM theory, then presenting Nekhoroshev’s theorem and finally introducing perturbation theory. We provide examples of stability results for some objects of the Solar system. Precisely, we consider the stability of the rotational motion of the Moon (or other planetary satellites) within the spin-orbit model by means of KAM theory, we analyze the stability of asteroids, also in the triangular equilibrium Lagrangian points, using Nekhoroshev’s theorem, we study the Earth’s satellite dynamics through perturbation theory."

When introducing OPC in the pentalayer alloys, we observe a reduction in switching times of 3.5%, 11%, and 40% for CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO devices, respectively. Furthermore, we calculate the current density required to reverse the magnetization of the free layer in CoPt, CoFeB, and EuO pentalayer devices, which is found to be $$0.78\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 0.78 × 10 12 A / m 2 , $$1.8\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 1.8 × 10 12 A / m 2 , and $$4.4\\times 10^{12} A/m^2$$ 4.4 × 10 12 A / m 2 , respectively. In addition, we investigate how the thicknesses of the free and spacer layers, as well as the wavelength and amplitude of interface roughness, affect the magnetization switching time. Understanding the effects of OPC paves the way for the practical implementation of spin transfer torque (STT)-based memory devices."

        "abstract": "We have looked at a very interesting class of Heusler alloy that has received a lot of theoretical research but a very little experimental attention. Mn_2TiSi Heusler alloy was synthesized by a conventional vacuum arc remelting process. The formation of Heusler phase along with the secondary phases was observed after annealing it at 773 K for 120 h. The X-ray diffraction pattern illustrates the presence of cubic B2 disordered phase along with a secondary phase with a lattice parameter of 5.82 Å. The microstructure and compositional analysis of Mn_2TiSi alloy shows the presence of distribution of Mn, Ti, and Si elements according to their stoichiometric ratio. The magnetic measurements show a ferromagnetic nature with Curie temperature ( T _C) around 203 K. With low magnetic moment and coercivity, Mn_2TiSi can be used for switching applications because of its fast magnetization reversal. So, Mn_2TiSi becomes the greatest choice for use in spintronics due to its low magnetic moment and low coercivity."

By controlling the relative phase and polarization of the probe and control beams, the angular momentum of the probe beam can be manipulated and controlled coherently. Substantial variation is investigated in the behavior of the graphs of two interfering waves with the Rabi frequencies of the control field, detuning of the probe and control fields and the angle between the two interfering waves. Magnetic spin vector field distribution and magnetic spin density of circularly, diagonally and linearly polarized probe light field are coherently controlled and modified. The major role in this modification is played by the detuning of the probe field and the parameters of the control fields.

We envisage that the spinel ferrite prepared by a particular route, namely spin coating, will in future optimize the essential parameters for optimal functioning of RRAM. An assertion to our assumptions, few researchers have already obtained important findings for spin coated spinel ferrites. Spin coated spinel ferrites, namely zinc ferrite, nickel ferrite, cobalt ferrite and mixed spinel ferrites, have been investigated for their applications as switching layers in RRAM devices. Particularly, spin coated cobalt ferrite, nickel ferrite and doped nickel ferrite were widely used as resistive switching layers. However, it is noticed that there is a tremendous scope for synthesis and resistive switching characterization of spin coated pure and doped zinc ferrite. Proper doping of special element into spinel ferrite can enhance the resistive switching performance of RRAM devices.

        "abstract": "Sliding and spinning behaviors significantly affect the performance of rolling bearings, especially for dry-lubricated bearings, micro and macro sliding may lead to increased wear of the solid lubricating film. A unified rolling contact tribology analytical model is proposed for dry-lubricated angular contact ball bearings (ACBBs) considering the extreme conditions including high combined loads and rolling contact effects. A comprehensive solution framework is proposed to ensure the robustness of the model under different loading conditions. Equilibrium equations are solved to study the effects of friction coefficients, rotating speeds, and combined loads on the skidding and spinning characteristics of the ACBB. The results show that the rolling contact effects and combined loads significantly affect the skidding and spinning performance of the ACBB. Further analysis reveals that the skidding mechanism is related to the interaction between ball kinematical motion and traction forces. The developed analytical model is proved to more accurately predict the bearing kinematical and tribological behavior as it discards the raceway control hypothesis and considers the macro/micro-slipping, creepage, and self-spinning motions of the ball, which is validated using both the existing pure axial loading dry-lubricated ACBB model and the classical Jones—Harris model.

With this comes the challenge of overall efficient deployment, in particular low-power and high-throughput implementations, under stringent memory constraints. In this context, non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) and spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) have significant advantages compared to conventional SRAM due to their non-volatility, higher cell density, and scalability features. While prior work has investigated several architectural implications of NVM for generic applications, in this chapter, we present DeepNVM++ , a comprehensive framework to characterize, model, and analyze NVM-based caches in GPU architectures for deep learning (DL) applications by combining technology-specific circuit-level models and the actual memory behavior of various DL workloads. DeepNVM++ relies on iso-capacity and iso-area performance and energy models for last-level caches implemented using conventional SRAM and emerging STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM technologies. In the iso-capacity case, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 3.8 × and 4.7 × energy-delay product (EDP) reduction and 2.4 × and 2.8 × area reduction compared to conventional SRAM, respectively. Under iso-area assumptions, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 2.2 × and 2.4 × EDP reduction and accommodate 2.3 × and 3.3 × cache capacity when compared to SRAM, respectively. We also perform a scalability analysis and show that STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM achieve orders of magnitude EDP reduction when compared to SRAM for large cache capacities.

Hence, the time scales on which one needs to investigate the stability of celestial objects are different. Therefore, the methods of study are themselves different and might lead to specific definitions of stability, either in the sense of bounds on the initial conditions or rather in the sense of confinement in a given region of the phase space. In this work we concentrate on three different methods: perturbation theory, Nekhoroshev’s theorem, KAM theory. All theories are constructive in the sense that they provide explicit algorithms to give estimates on the parameters of the system and on the stability time. Perturbation theory gives results on finite time scales, Nekhoroshev’s theorem provides stability results on exponentially long times, KAM theory ensures the confinement between invariant tori in low-dimensional systems. We recall the basic ingredients of each theory, starting with KAM theory, then presenting Nekhoroshev’s theorem and finally introducing perturbation theory. We provide examples of stability results for some objects of the Solar system. Precisely, we consider the stability of the rotational motion of the Moon (or other planetary satellites) within the spin-orbit model by means of KAM theory, we analyze the stability of asteroids, also in the triangular equilibrium Lagrangian points, using Nekhoroshev’s theorem, we study the Earth’s satellite dynamics through perturbation theory."

The goal of this paper is to show that it is possible to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the computation of quasi-periodic attractors for parameter values extremely close to the breakdown and, therefore, it is possible to obtain information on the breakdown mechanism of these quasi-periodic attractors. The method uses at the same time numerical and rigorous improvements to provide (i) a very accurate computation of the time-1 map of the spin–orbit problem (which reduces the dimensionality of the problem); (ii) a very efficient KAM method for maps which computes the attractor and its tangent spaces (by quadratically convergent, low storage requirements, and low operation count); (iii) explicit algorithms backed by a rigorous a posteriori KAM theorem, which establishes that if the algorithm is successful and produces a small residual, then there is a true solution nearby; and (iv) guaranteed algorithms to reach arbitrarily close to the border of existence as long as there are enough computer resources. As a by-product of the accuracy that we maintain till breakdown, we study several scale-invariant observables of the tori used in the renormalization group of infinite-dimensional spaces. In contrast with previously studied simple models, the behavior at breakdown of the spin–orbit problem does not satisfy standard scaling relations which implies that the spin–orbit problem is not described by a hyperbolic fixed point of the renormalization operator."

However, variations caused by road roughness, vehicle speed, and load can lead to stability switches and sudden events in seat vibration excitation. Ignoring these factors in semi-active and active seat suspensions can cause insufficient robustness and excessive costs. To address this, we propose an intelligent damping switching method that optimizes seat suspension damping mode by considering the stability and suddenness of excitation. Utilizing a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we accurately identify stability, while the multi-input and multi-output optimization (MIMO) method labels the network input through system identification of the seat dynamics model. Event trigger (ET) handles suddenness effectively. By combining these techniques, our approach achieves effective vibration isolation while maintaining the desired suspension deflection.

        "abstract": "As the world increasingly turns to renewable energy sources, the integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the grid has emerged as a pivotal solution. Effective control methods are paramount to harnessing the full potential of these grid-connected PV systems. While existing control methods have laid a foundation, there persists a compelling need for innovative approaches capable of surpassing the limitations of conventional methods. This paper introduces a novel nonlinear control approach utilizing an enhanced Lyapunov function for a single-phase PV/grid electric power system. High-performance operation of the solar PV system, interfacing with a grid-connected single-stage inverter, is achieved through the control of maximum PV voltage using predictive voltage control for MPPT. The enhanced Lyapunov function maintains PV voltage stability at the dc-bus by treating the difference between PV voltage and its reference as a controlled state error. Notably, this approach ensures the stability of the closed-loop PV system even under varying solar irradiances. To achieve full active power injection into the grid with high quality, the proposed enhanced Lyapunov function is augmented by integrating an LCL filter with virtual resistance as an active damping circuit for grid current feedback control. This integration introduces an opposing current to the grid-side inductance current. This compensation mechanism corrects the q -axis grid current using the dq-SRF mathematical model of the global PV/grid system. The LCL parameters and virtual resistance design methods are provided. The effectiveness of the enhanced Lyapunov function is demonstrated through simulations using MATLAB/Simulink software. The results showcase outstanding performance when compared to conventional Lyapunov function and sliding mode control strategies in achieving key objectives, including zero state errors, global stability, and the generation of a sinusoidal grid current signal with low total harmonic distortion and the unit power factor at the point of common coupling."

Methods A novel method has been successfully developed to model and analyze the forced damped response of centrifugally stiffened Timoshenko beam. The method uses a single beam element with six physical nodal coordinates. The transverse displacement and rotation of the beam are described using a mixture of polynomial and enriching trigonometric shape functions. The damping matrix is incorporated into the equations of motion (EOM) according to Rayleigh assumption. The damped EOM are expressed in state space form. Results The dynamic characteristics for the rotating forced damped vibration of Timoshenko beam are analyzed by assuming modal damping ratios for the first two modes and then finding the constants for the proportional damping. The EOM are integrated numerically to evaluate the system’s dynamic time response under various rotating speeds, external loading conditions, and modal damping ratios. Notably, the study goes a step further, providing a comprehensive exploration of the frequency response function (FRF) across a spectrum of parameter changes. The validity and efficiency of the developed method are demonstrated through numerical examples across various cases. Conclusions Proportional damping is pivotal for controlling vibrations, stability, and energy dissipation in rotating beams, shaping their response characteristics. It affects the damping ratio, natural frequency, and amplitude of the beam’s response. Higher damping ratios lead to quicker vibration decay, lower natural frequencies, and diminished amplitudes."

Firstly, the single-axis two-degree-of-freedom suspension model of motorcycle semi-active suspension system (SASS) and the look-up table model of solenoid valve damper are established. After that, the classical SASS control algorithms such as skyhook and groundhook are analyzed. HCFD is designed and verified for its inability to perfectly balance the comfort and road-holding performance of motorcycle. Finally, a real motorcycle experimental platform is built using the rapid control prototype (RCP) based on dSPACE, and the HCFD is tested and verified on washboard roads. The experimental results show that the SASS using the HCFD not only enhances driving comfort but also effectively mitigates concerns related to a decline in road-holding performance. The HCFD has practical significance to improve the comprehensive performance of motorcycle SASS."

Methodology The study confirms the coal in the present study as bituminous coal by analyzing the microstructure and composition of coal using scanning electron microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy method. Objective The damping characteristics (resonant frequency, damping ratio) and dynamic shear modulus of the coal are determined using the resonant column test and the ultrasonic pulse velocity test. Further, numerical simulations using the finite-element method (FEM) in ABAQUS software are performed to obtain resonant frequencies for intact coal samples under torsional and flexural vibrations, and the results of the experimental and numerical studies are found to be in good agreement.

        "abstract": "Purpose In this paper, a high-static-low-dynamic-stiffness (HSLDS) isolator with geometric nonlinear damping is proposed in order to improve the performance of low-frequency vibration isolation. The geometric nonlinear damping characteristic of the HSLDS system is analyzed. Methods The Lagrange principle is employed to establish the differential equation of motion of a vibration system with the proposed isolator. The harmonic balance method (HBM) is then applied to derive the steady-state responses under base and force excitations, respectively. The vibration isolation performance of the proposed system is thus analyzed and discussed for different parameters. Results The results show that increasing nonlinear damping can significantly reduce the displacement transmissibility peak in the resonant zone without apparently influencing the performance at higher frequencies. Similarly, when subjected to force excitation, an increase in nonlinear damping notably reduces the force transmissibility peak in the resonant region while the vibration isolation performance at higher frequencies remains unaffected. It is also determined that increasing the stiffness ratio can effectively suppress the displacement and force transmissibility, and extend the isolation region. Conclusion It is found that the integration of geometric nonlinear damping into the HSLDS isolator effectively enhances system performance and is suitable for low-frequency vibration isolation."

        "abstract": "The present study proposes a novel eddy-current-based tuned inerter damper (EC-TID) that integrates the tuned inerter damper (TID) with nonlinear eddy current damping. The inclusion of nonlinear eddy current damping is expected to improve the control performance of optimal TID. In particular, the mechanical model and configuration of proposed EC-TID are introduced in detail. A closed-form solution for EC-TID optimal design in both undamped and damped structures is established based on effective damping ratio enhancement (EDRE) effect. This closed-form solution ensures equivalence of nonlinear eddy current damping through employment of statistical linearization techniques (SLT) with both force-based and energy-based equivalent criteria. The EC-TID control effectiveness obtained through Monte Carlo simulation under white noise excitation, which include effective damping ratio and EDRE effect, verifies the accuracy of the closed-form solution established via SLT, and highlights the importance of a large critical velocity of EC-TID in achieving higher accuracy. Moreover, it has been found that the closed-form solution for EC-TID and eddy-current-based tuned viscous mass damper (EC-TVMD) optimal design exhibit significant similarities when their equivalent damping ratios are identical. Several numerical studies have been conducted to investigate the control performance of EC-TID under real seismic excitations. The results demonstrate that both TID and EC-TID exhibit superior EDRE effects in mitigating the seismic response of structures compared to viscous and eddy current dampers with the same damping parameters. Additionally, EC-TID offers improved performance over TID, including slightly higher effectiveness, pre-designed maximum damping force, and reduced deformation. Noted that EC-TID is more effective than EC-TVMD in reducing structural seismic responses when their equivalent damping ratio is set at 0.03. This finding contrasts with a recent study where TID and tuned viscous mass damper (TVMD) exhibited comparable effectiveness under the same conditions."

A precursor solution was deposited on the internal surface of porous aluminum oxide membrane, using an assembly consisting of a vacuum system coupled to an apparatus, which assists in the entry of the used precursor solution, breaking the barriers related to the existing surface tension, with subsequent heat treatment to form the single phase of yttrium iron garnet (YIG).

Here, exchange biased NiFe/FeMn bilayers have been shown to offer excellent opportunities for a new class of bias-field-free magnonic/microwave medium. Magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal a dependence on the exchange bias effect as a function of FeMn layer thickness. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements reveal magnetic oscillations at remanence for various thicknesses of FeMn, which also determines the frequency of the mode oscillations. Angular field dependent results indicate uniaxial anisotropy present in the bilayers. The in-plane magnetic anisotropy field is found to be decreased with an increase in the FeMn thickness. Further investigation on the invariance of resonance field and linear increase of linewidth with frequency shows the negligible extrinsic contribution to the overall effective damping. Relatively large effective Gilbert damping values are obtained for the higher FeMn thickness and can be attributed to the exchange bias anisotropy. Observation of low inhomogeneous linewidth broadening indicates a good quality of magnetic layer and the interfaces in our systems. Our results offer a novel route for the bias-field-free magnetic medium that supports high-frequency oscillations along with its suitability for on-chip device integration."

Microstructure studies revealed that adding a trace amount of Al_2O_3 NPs to the eutectic (SAC355) system refine the crystallite size of both rhombohedral β-Sn, orthorhombic Cu_6Sn_5 and Ag_3Sn IMCs. The elastic modulus ( E ) and Vickers microhardness (Hv) were improved. This can be attributed to the interstitial dispersion of Al_2O_3 NPs at grain boundaries, which make snail-like Ag_3Sn particles more uniformly distributed within β-Sn matrix that could obstruct the dislocation slipping. The results showed that creep resistance ( n ) decreases from dislocation climb value at 0.1 wt.% to grain boundary sliding value at 1 wt.% Al_2O_3 NPs content. Electrical resistance ( ρ ), Fermi energy ( E _f), and Fermi velocity ( V _f) increased with Al_2O_3 NPs content, while electron concentration ( N ) decreased due to increased charge carrier scattering centers. However, increasing the doping content of Al_2O_3 NPs led to an increase in the melting temperature ( T _m), compared with plain solder. All results showed that Al_2O_3 NPs addition has an effective method to enhance new lead-free solder joints."

        "abstract": "Effective-medium theory pertains to the theoretical modelling of homogenization, which aims to replace an inhomogeneous structure of subwavelength-scale constituents with a homogeneous effective medium. The effective-medium theory is fundamental to various realms, including electromagnetics and material science, since it can largely decrease the complexity in the exploration of light-matter interactions by providing simple acceptable approximation. Generally, the effective-medium theory is thought to be applicable to any all-dielectric system with deep-subwavelength constituents, under the condition that the effective medium does not have a critical angle, at which the total internal reflection occurs. Here we reveal a fundamental breakdown of the effective-medium theory that can be applied in very general conditions: showing it for deep-subwavelength all-dielectric multilayers even without a critical angle. Our finding relies on an exotic photonic spin Hall effect, which is shown to be ultrasensitive to the stacking order of deep-subwavelength dielectric layers, since the spin-orbit interaction of light is dependent on slight phase accumulations during the wave propagation. Our results indicate that the photonic spin Hall effect could provide a promising and powerful tool for measuring structural defects for all-dielectric systems even in the extreme nanometer scale."

        "abstract": "The development of wearable multifunctional electromagnetic protective fabrics with multifunctional, low cost, and high efficiency remains a challenge. Here, inspired by the unique flower branch shape of “Thunberg’s meadowsweet” in nature, a nanofibrous composite membrane with hierarchical structure was constructed. Integrating sophisticated 0D@2D@1D hierarchical structures with multiple heterointerfaces can fully unleash the multifunctional application potential of composite membrane. The targeted induction method was used to precisely regulate the formation site and morphology of the metal–organic framework precursor, and intelligently integrate multiple heterostructures to enhance dielectric polarization, which improves the impedance matching and loss mechanisms of the electromagnetic wave absorbing materials. Due to the synergistic enhancement of electrospinning-derived carbon nanofiber “stems”, MOF-derived carbon nanosheet “petals” and transition metal selenide nano-particle “stamens”, the Co_xSe_y/NiSe@CNSs@CNFs (CNCC) composite membrane obtains a minimum reflection loss value (RL_min) of -68.40 dB at 2.6 mm and a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 8.88 GHz at a thin thickness of 2.0 mm with a filling amount of only 5 wt%. In addition, the multi-component and hierarchical heterostructure endow the fibrous membrane with excellent flexibility, water resistance, thermal management, and other multifunctional properties. This work provides unique perspectives for the precise design and rational application of multifunctional fabrics. Electrospinning combined with structural engineering to construct 0D@2D@1D hierarchical heterogeneous interfaces. A “mechanical response” model was constructed to explain the stress transfer mechanism of fibrous membranes with 2D@1D structures.

Here, we report the growth of high-quality Ta_0.7Nb_0.3Sb_2 single crystals via the chemical vapor transport (CVT). Clear sign of the WAL effect is observed below 50 K, probably due to the strong spin—orbital coupling in 3D bulk. In addition, it is worth noting that a relatively large MR of 120% appears under 1 T magnetic field at T = 2 K. Hall measurements and two-band model fitting results reveal high carrier mobility (>1000 cm^2· V^−1·s−^1 in 2–300 K region), and off-compensation electron/hole ratio of ∼8:1. Due to the angular dependence of the WAL effect and the fermiology of the Ta_0.7Nb_0.3Sb_2 crystals, interesting magnetic-field-induced changes of the symmetry of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (MR) from two-fold (≤ 0.6 T) to four-fold (0.8–1.5 T) and finally to two-fold (≥ 2 T) are observed. This phenomenon is attributed to the mechanism shift from the low-field WAL dominated MR to WAL and fermiology co-dominated MR and finally to high-field fermiology dominated MR. All these signs indicate that Ta_0.7Nb_0.3Sb_2 may be a topological semimetal candidate, and these magnetotransport properties may attract more theoretical and experimental exploration of the (Ta,Nb)Sb_2 family."

The resistance tomography-based tactile sensors have been introduced as a promising approach to creating soft tactile skins because the sensor fabrication can be greatly simplified with the aid of a computation model. This article introduces an electronic design strategy dividing frontend and backend electronics for the resistance tomography-based tactile sensors. In this scheme, the frontend is made of the piezoresistive structure and electrodes that can be changed depending on the required geometry. The backend is the electronic circuit for resistance tomography, which can be used for various frontend geometries. To evaluate the use of a unified backend for different frontend geometries, two frontend specimens with a square shape and a circular shape are tested. The minimum detectable contact force and the minimum discernible contact distance are calculated as $$0.83 \\times 10^{-4}$$ 0.83 × 10 - 4  N/mm $$^2$$ 2 , 2.51 mm for the square-shaped frontend and $$1.19 \\times 10^{-4}$$ 1.19 × 10 - 4  N/mm $$^2$$ 2 , 3.42 mm for the circular-shaped frontend.

The paper specifically explores the fine-scale microstructures of highly porous sintered attachments under power cycling to provide a deeper understanding of the significance of porosity as a reliability-related microstructural parameter. Attachments prepared at 220°C using a pressure of 6 MPa for 1 s (parameters known to generate approximately 50% porosity from previous work) and subsequently subjected to 650,000 power cycles between 50°C and 200°C are assessed. A correlative workflow integrating x-ray computed tomography, focused ion beam (FIB) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data is applied to merge meso- and nanoscale microstructural features to illuminate the degradation mechanisms. The as-sintered Ag layer has a high volume of heterogeneously distributed pores, and consists of randomly oriented equiaxed grains whose sizes vary depending on the local density of the region sampled. Power cycling promotes grain growth and the loss of twin boundaries, and these changes are more pronounced within more dense regions of the Ag attachment. In contrast, the copper substrate appears to undergo some grain refinement, with deformation twins visible within finer-grained zones during power cycling. Cracks, which appear to start off within the Ag layer, propagate across the Ag-Cu boundary and transgranularly through fine-grained regions within the copper with little tortuosity. These observations are discussed within the context of reliability behaviour. Graphical Abstract "

Since the coating properties are dependent on the plasma spray parameters, a variation of set parameters is assessed, which are currently used for the coating of the bare dies.

Here, exchange biased NiFe/FeMn bilayers have been shown to offer excellent opportunities for a new class of bias-field-free magnonic/microwave medium. Magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal a dependence on the exchange bias effect as a function of FeMn layer thickness. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements reveal magnetic oscillations at remanence for various thicknesses of FeMn, which also determines the frequency of the mode oscillations. Angular field dependent results indicate uniaxial anisotropy present in the bilayers. The in-plane magnetic anisotropy field is found to be decreased with an increase in the FeMn thickness. Further investigation on the invariance of resonance field and linear increase of linewidth with frequency shows the negligible extrinsic contribution to the overall effective damping. Relatively large effective Gilbert damping values are obtained for the higher FeMn thickness and can be attributed to the exchange bias anisotropy. Observation of low inhomogeneous linewidth broadening indicates a good quality of magnetic layer and the interfaces in our systems. Our results offer a novel route for the bias-field-free magnetic medium that supports high-frequency oscillations along with its suitability for on-chip device integration."

        "abstract": "We present a novel cavity opto-magno-mechanical hybrid system to generate entanglements among multiple quantum carriers, such as magnons, mechanical resonators, and cavity photons in both the optical and microwave domains. Two Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres are embedded in two separate microwave cavities which are joined by a communal mechanical resonator. Because the microwave cavities are separate, the ferromagnetic resonate frequencies of two YIG spheres can be tuned independently, as well as the cavity frequencies. We show that entanglement can be achieved with experimentally reachable parameters. The entanglement is robust against environmental thermal noise, owing to the mechanical cooling process achieved by the optical cavity. The maximum entanglement among different carriers is achieved by optimizing the parameters of the system. The individual tunability of the separated cavities allows us to independently control the entanglement properties of different subsystems and establish quantum channels with different entanglement properties in one system. This work could provide promising applications in quantum metrology and quantum information tasks."

Based on the quantum theory, the reduced master equation of magnon modes is derived by adiabatically eliminating the cavity variables. The results show that the entanglement and one-way EPR steering of two distant magnons could be obtained and controlled by adequately selecting the physical parameters such as magneto-optical coupling strength, the coupling efficiency of cascaded cavities, and magnon dissipation rate. The remarkable feature of our scheme is that the generated bipartite correlations are insensitive to the dynamical parameter fluctuations. Furthermore, the simplified operation and actual parameters make the scheme more feasible, which may provide a new platform for the study of the macroscopic quantum phenomenon and quantum information processing."

        "abstract": "Efficient manipulation of magnetic textures by spin–orbit torque is of great significance to spintronic and magnonic technologies. Here, using micromagnetic simulations, we exploit the dynamics of a Bloch-type stripe domain wall in a magnetic nanowire induced by the spin-Hall effect associated with a ferromagnet/heavy metal structure. Our numerical results demonstrate that, contrary to the Néel-type stripe domain wall, the stripe Bloch domain wall varies its internal spin configuration in response to the applied electric current and, in the meantime, travels toward an edge of the nanowire. The higher the current density applied, the nearer the domain wall approaches the edge. Thereby, the stripe Bloch domain wall is movable to any desired position with respect to the edge by fine-tuning the current density and/or its action time. These discoveries will find application in reconfigurable spin-wave channeling based on magnetic domain walls."

Our numerical results show that the magnetoelastic coupling between magnon and phonon is significantly larger than the optomechanical coupling between photon and phonon. In addition to directly coupled modes entanglements, indirectly coupled bipartition also shows a strong correlation when we consider the magnon frequency to be much larger than the phonon frequency and magnon decay rate to be less than the cavity decay rate. Furthermore, we also obtained the robustness of entanglement, among all bipartitions, against thermal and environmental fluctuations.

The two MW fields can be entangled if they are, respectively, resonant with two sidebands of the mechanical mode. Interestingly, the numerical simulation results show that the magnon interaction with two MV cavity modes leads to an enhanced entanglement spectrum of directly (magnon–phonon) and indirectly (cavity–phonon) coupled modes.

The interaction is the most intense at the phase matching frequencies of the ESW and AW. In this case, there are effects of hybridization and energy conversion of ESW → AW type. The phase matching condition is fulfilled due to the transformation of the ESW lengths within the thickness of the transition layer. Coupling is weakened away from phase matching points; waves propagate independently of each other. Moreover, the acoustic wave can freely penetrate deep into the nonmagnetic substrate of the yttrium iron garnet film. In the future, this can be useful for providing phonon coupling of spin-wave excitations in films located on opposite sides of a nonmagnetic substrate."

Assisted by the Floquet engineering, effective couplings among the photon mode in the resonator and two magnon modes are constructed and can induce a chiral Fock-state transfer from the photon mode to one magnon mode, for which the magnonic Fock-state receiver mode is dependent of the qubit state. Therefore, a superposed qubit state can exactly lead to a magnonic NOON state. Compared with the recent scheme of generating magnonic NOON states (Qi and Jing in Phys Rev A 107:013702, 2023) that uses constant effective couplings, the present scheme designs Gaussian-type soft control of effective couplings, which observably improves the fidelity and robustness of generating the magnonic NOON state."

However, engineering coherent quantum state transfer between magnons and specific information carriers, in particular, mechanical oscillators and solid-state spins, remains challenging due to the intrinsically weak interactions and the frequency mismatch between different components. Here, we show how to strongly couple the magnon modes in a nanomagnet to the quantized mechanical motion (phonons) of a micromechanical cantilever in a hybrid tripartite system. The coherent and enhanced magnon-phonon coupling is engineered by introducing the quantum parametric amplification of the mechanical motion. With experimentally feasible parameters, we show that the mechanical parametric drive can be adjusted to drive the system into the strong-coupling regime and even the ultrastrong-coupling regime. Furthermore, we show the coherent state transfer between the nanomagnet and a nitrogen-vacancy center in the dispersive-coupling regime, with the magnon-spin interaction mediated by the virtually-excited squeezed phonons. The amplified mechanical noise can hardly interrupt the coherent dynamics of the system even for low mechanical quality factors, which removes the requirement of applying additional engineered-reservoir techniques.

Nowadays, many QAs have been proposed, whose general conclusion is that using the effects of quantum mechanics results in a significant speedup (exponential, polynomial, super polynomial) over the traditional algorithms. This implies that some complex problems currently intractable with traditional algorithms can be solved with QA. On the other hand, DL algorithms offer what is known as machine learning techniques. DL is concerned with teaching a computer to filter inputs through layers to learn how to predict and classify information. Observations can be in the form of plain text, images, or sound.

Different from most schemes that use the dissipation of the system to control quantum steering, in our scheme the one-way steering can be modulated on demand by adjusting the coherent coupling ratio between the two magnons and the cavity, which provides a flexible and feasible way in experiments.

Compared with the recent Rydberg-atom SWAP gate scheme, the present one possesses the undegraded first-order dynamics and shows an interference-induced suppression of the doubly-excited Rydberg state, so it costs shorter gate time and exhibits greater robustness against atomic decay and deviations in the interatomic separation (interaction strengths). The present mechanism of implementing a SWAP gate on interacting Rydberg atoms could facilitate high-fidelity demonstrations of atomic ground state transformation and further exploitation of peculiar dynamics."

        "abstract": "A quantum designated multi- verifier signature (QDMVS) scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the signer can simultaneously designate multiple verifiers to verify the validity of the signature; the signature’s validity can be verified if and only if all the designated verifiers involve in the verification process. Moreover, all the verifiers can work together to generate an indistinguishable signature from the signer, so any third party can not confirm whether the signer or all the verifiers signed the original message. Security analysis shows that our QDMVS scheme is resistant to various attacks. On top of that, our scheme does not need any trusted third party, quantum one- way functions (QOWF), or quantum state swapping tests (SWAP). Therefore, the proposed QDMVS scheme is more efficient than similar schemes."

This study uses a trainable variational quantum circuit (VQC) on a gate-based quantum computing model to investigate the potential for quantum benefit in a model-free reinforcement learning problem. Through a comprehensive investigation and evaluation of the current model and capabilities of quantum computers, we designed and trained a novel hybrid quantum neural network based on the latest Qiskit and PyTorch framework. We compared its performance with a full-classical CNN with and without an incorporated VQC. Our research provides insights into the potential of deep quantum learning to solve a maze problem and, potentially, other reinforcement learning problems. We conclude that reinforcement learning problems can be practical with reasonable training epochs. Moreover, a comparative study of full-classical and hybrid quantum neural networks is discussed to understand these two approaches’ performance, advantages, and disadvantages to deep Q-learning problems, especially on larger-scale maze problems larger than 4 $$\\times $$ × 4."

Under mild assumptions, we give tight reductions from MCE to the homogenous version of the Quadratic Maps Linear Equivalence ( QMLE ) problem, and vice versa. Furthermore, we present reductions to and from similar problems in the sum-rank metric, showing that MCE is at the core of code equivalence problems. On the practical side, using birthday techniques known for IP , we present two algorithms: a probabilistic algorithm for MCE running in time $$q^{\\frac{2}{3}(n+m)}$$ q 2 3 ( n + m ) up to a polynomial factor, and a deterministic algorithm for MCE with roots, running in time $$q^{\\min \\{m,n,k\\}}$$ q min { m , n , k } up to a polynomial factor.

Respiratory diseases may severely damage the respiratory system of humans. The early diagnosis of it can help enable appropriate treatment immediately to reduce the abnormalities in the healthcare monitoring systems. A chest X-ray could be used as one of the medical tools to assess the severity of respiratory diseases. In order to predict or classify respiratory diseases, many researchers have proposed different deep learning-based models. But they consume more computational resources. This article proposes a hybrid framework for respiratory disease detection based on a quantum feature extractor and custom classifier model (HQF-CC) from Chest X-rays. Here, we propose a quantum machine learning algorithm named MMS (Multi-Multi-Single) for feature extraction and a custom classifier for classification.

The proposed model had the highest training and testing accuracy of 97.2% and 98.8% on the CRD dataset and a training and testing loss of 0.02, 0.01. Upon various experiments, the proposed model has proven to be more accurate, portable, and memory-efficient than other deep and machine learning models for respiratory disease detection."

The approach of bias-enhanced nucleation (BEN) followed by growth is studied for processing of oriented diamond film with azimuthal texture. The magnitude of the applied electric field is shown to play an important role in processing of the highly azimuthally textured diamond film on Si (100) substrate. The X-ray diffraction pole figure, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy results show that an optimum applied electric field during BEN and microwave plasma conditions lead to formation of diamond film with azimuthal texture upon growth by MPECVD.

        "abstract": "Currently, quantum neural networks (QNNs) have achieved some success in image classification due to their strong computational capabilities. However, as the number of layers in QNNs increases, the training process becomes complex and the accuracy tends to be low, resulting in poor network stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a shallow hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (SHQCNN) model. Specifically, the SHQCNN model is built on an enhanced variational quantum method that is effective for image classification. In the input layer, the model uses a kernel coding method to make data easier to distinguish. In the hidden layer, a variational quantum circuit is designed to reduce the depth and complexity of the network. The output layer uses a mini-batch gradient descent algorithm for parameter training, which improves learning speed by performing weight updates more frequently. The SHQCNN model can achieve high stability and accuracy in image classification, which effectively solves the issue of gradient disappearance caused by too many layers in the network. Its feasibility and practicality are verified by comparing it with the classical neural network (CNN) model. Its generalization and stability as well as its noise immunity are verified on various datasets with different amounts of noise. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed SHQCNN model. For example, compared with CNN, its accuracy rate is improved by 6.66%, reaching 99.58%."

Knowing this image allows one to descend to a proper subgroup unless the hidden subgroup is the full group. The transformation relies on finding zero sum subsequences of sufficiently large sequences of vectors over finite prime fields. We present a new deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the latter problem in the case when the size of the field is constant. The consequence is a polynomial time exact quantum algorithm for the hidden subgroup problem in nilpotent groups having constant nilpotency class and whose order only have prime factors also bounded by a constant."

In this scheme, a four-qubit maximally entangled cluster channel, classical communication, and several local quantum gates are employed. Quantum teleportation is required in the first stage of the scheme and in the second stage, the state preparer disentangles the left over entangled states by a two-qubit projective measurement process and conveys some classical messages to different parties so that accurate copies or orthogonal-complement copies are produced. To produce more copies or orthogonal-complement copies in the two-type-output assisted cloning scheme, we discuss our scheme for producing two copies and three copies of each unknown single-qubit state and suggest how to generalise this to N copies and orthogonal-complement copies of each unknown single-qubit state using the product of two multi-qubit GHZ-type states as quantum channel. In addition, by using the product of N EPR pairs as the quantum channel, the two-type-output assisted cloning scheme for arbitrary unknown single-qubit states is extended to the case of N -type-output ( $$N\\ge 3$$ N ≥ 3 ) to meet the needs of the development of quantum networks."

With this comes the challenge of overall efficient deployment, in particular low-power and high-throughput implementations, under stringent memory constraints. In this context, non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) and spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) have significant advantages compared to conventional SRAM due to their non-volatility, higher cell density, and scalability features. While prior work has investigated several architectural implications of NVM for generic applications, in this chapter, we present DeepNVM++ , a comprehensive framework to characterize, model, and analyze NVM-based caches in GPU architectures for deep learning (DL) applications by combining technology-specific circuit-level models and the actual memory behavior of various DL workloads. DeepNVM++ relies on iso-capacity and iso-area performance and energy models for last-level caches implemented using conventional SRAM and emerging STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM technologies. In the iso-capacity case, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 3.8 × and 4.7 × energy-delay product (EDP) reduction and 2.4 × and 2.8 × area reduction compared to conventional SRAM, respectively. Under iso-area assumptions, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 2.2 × and 2.4 × EDP reduction and accommodate 2.3 × and 3.3 × cache capacity when compared to SRAM, respectively. We also perform a scalability analysis and show that STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM achieve orders of magnitude EDP reduction when compared to SRAM for large cache capacities. DeepNVM++ is demonstrated on STT-/SOT-MRAM technologies and can be used for the characterization, modeling, and analysis of any NVM technology for last-level caches in GPUs for DL applications."

A variety of semiconductor memories are in development with different concepts of memory cells for various applications.

VM needs to be provided power constantly to retain data, such as static random access memory (SRAM), which uses several transistors per memory cell, and dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which uses a single transistor and a capacitor per cell. In contrast, NVM retrieves stored information even after the power goes down. Examples of NVM include read-only memory (ROM), flash memory with floating gate MOS transistor per cell, and several emerging memories, such as ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), spin transfer torque magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM), resistive RAM (RRAM), and phase change RAM (PCM).

The particular point of view adopted will focus on the advancements achieved by these competing devices and, most importantly, the challenges that these technologies must face in the next years. We decided to limit the analysis to four main competing technologies, namely, OxRAM (oxide-based resistive random access memory), PCM (phase change memory), STT-MRAM (spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM), and FeFET (ferroelectric field effect transistor). These four best show the development of the research activity on emerging memory devices, going from the most recent FeFET to one of the most mature PCMs. As each technology is based on a completely different physics, the challenges that each must face on are totally different. The chapter is composed of four sessions. The first one highlights the need to overcome the concept of “universal memory,” a longed-for memory device that could be tuned to substitute any memory currently preset in the PC memory hierarchy by minor adjustments and that could thus impose itself as the only memory really necessary. We will see how this concept, although very attractive and seducing, is unrealistic and must be abandoned to be replaced by an application-centric point of view, where each domain dictates the specifications that a memory has to provide and decide at the end what kind of device suits best. In the second session, the four memory candidates are presented. A very short history of each is sketched and their working principle is briefly depicted. Session three is the chapter core. The four memory devices are compared to each other; the advantages of each are analyzed along with their main drawbacks and flaws. Each memory, although at a different maturity level, has many challenges to overcome, and the session provides explication of each. The main research axes and strategies are reviewed trying to give the reader the feeling of the effort that developers are putting into solving the memory puzzle. Many trade-offs must be made, and the apparently endless chase between application requirements and device capability makes the path extremely difficult. The last part of session three is devoted to some innovative applications that eNVM could actually boost. In these cases researches are trying to exploit the device drawbacks as actual advantages. A review of the main of these applications is provided, showing that even for this case challenges are not missing. In session four a particular attention is posed on one of the emerging applications treated in session three. Neuromorphic applications are indeed of very high interest at the moment, and eNVMs are regarded with very high interest. We will explain why eNVMs are attracting so much interest in the neuromorphic domain, how they can bring some solution to the manufacturing of neural network, and how, at the same time, new challenges emerge for eNVM to meet the constraints of these applications."

The three strands formed a double-stranded structure, and fluorescence would not be quenched by Fe_3O_4/C. In the absence of ACE, Cs2-FAM would be in a single-chain state and would be adsorbed by Fe_3O_4/C, and the fluorescence of FAM would be quenched by Fe_3O_4/C via photoelectron transfer. This aptasensor sensitively detected ACE over a linear concentration range of 10–1000 nM with a limit of detection of 3.41 nM. The recoveries of ACE spiked in cabbage and celery samples ranged from 89.49% to 110.76% with high accuracy. Graphical abstract "

        "abstract": "The current study aims to identify the extent to which bimetallic nanoparticles (NPS) are considered highly effective in removing p -nitrophenol (PNP) and its derivatives from wastewater by using various bimetallic NPS. Many previous studies have been conducted to determine the conversion rate and reduction cycles of all types of bimetallic NPS. The findings indicated that PNP is removed by using bimetallic NPS to help reduce it into p-aminophenol (PAP). Besides, noble metals are considered the most effective metals that can be used in bimetallic NPS for their high conversion rate, ranging from 95 to 100%. However, it was concluded that bimetallic NPS of transition metals can serve as efficient catalysts that help to reduce PNP into PAP in the presence of sodium borohydride (NaBH_4) as a reducing agent. In this review, we focused on the impact of PNP on health and the challenges of removing PNP and its derivatives from wastewater. In addition, a critical analysis of various types of bimetallic NPS has been reported. Further, we also recommended establishing empirical research-based studies using real-life practical experiments and using different reducing agents such as hydrazine and sodium citrate other than NaBH_4."

The chemical oxidative polymerization method was used to synthesize the PPy and TiO_2/PPy composite (in-situ approach was used for doping). The synthesized samples were characterized by experimental techniques, viz . differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and IV characteristics to investigate the thermal and electrical properties. DSC revealed that the TiO_2/PPy composite has higher glass transition and melting temperature than bare PPy suggesting that the composite is more thermally stable. Additionally, TiO_2/PPy composite has enhanced electrical conduction compared to bare PPy. This signifies that the interfacial interaction between TiO_2 and PPy provides a smooth path for the transfer of charges from one site to another. Hence, the thermal and electrical properties significantly enhance with the formation of TiO_2/PPy composite compared to bare PPy."

This paper reports on a comparative study of using either acetic acid (AA) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the representative UiO-66 organic modulators for synthesizing visible light responsive UiO-66(Zr)-X (X: NH_2 or NO_2) photocatalysts for water splitting. The results show that photocatalytic hydrogen generation from a water/methanol mixture can be improved by varying the nature and amount of the modulator employed to prepare the different UiO-66(Zr)-X (X: NH_2 or NO_2) solid derivatives. UiO-66(Zr)-NH_2 was the most active photocatalyst, followed by UiO-66(Zr)-NO_2, both prepared with 12 equivalents of AA with respect to the organic ligand. This UiO-66(Zr)-NH_2 solid was more active than the parent MOF in photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) (H_2 and O_2 production of 450 and 160 µmol·g^−1, respectively, in 5 h; apparent quantum yield (AQY) at 400 nm of 0.06%) in the absence of methanol and compares favourably with analogous reports. Information on the photocatalytic activity of the most active solids of both series was obtained by means of a series of techniques, including ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), laser flash photolysis (LFP), electron spin resonance (ESR), photoluminescence and photoelectrochemical measurements together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Although several remediation approaches are available, adsorption and photodegradation technologies are presented in this review as one of the best options because of their environmental friendliness, cost-effectiveness, accessibility, less selectivity, and wider scope of applications among others. The bandgap, particle size, surface area, electrical properties, thermal stability, reusability, chemical stability, and other properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPS) are highlighted to account for their suitability in adsorption and photocatalytic applications, concerning organic contaminants. Literatures have been reviewed on the application of various AgNPS as adsorbent and photocatalyst in the remediation of several classes of organic contaminants. Theories of adsorption have also been outlined while photocatalysis is seen to have adsorption as the initial mechanism. Challenges facing the application of silver nanoparticles have also been highlighted and possible solutions have been presented. However, current information is dominated by applications on dyes and the view of the authors supports the need to strengthen the usefulness of AgNPS in adsorption and photodegradation of more classes of organic contaminants, especially emerging contaminants.

        "abstract": "Purpose With about ten-fold smaller diameter than MBs, nanobubbles (NBs) were developed as new-generation ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) able to extravasate and target specific receptors expressed on extravascular cancer cells, such as the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). It has been shown that PSMA-targeted NBs (PSMA-NBs) can bind to specific prostate cancer (PCa) cells and exhibit a prolonged retention effect (PRE), observable by NB-based CEUS (NB-CEUS). However, previous analyses of PRE were mainly limited to the semi-quantitative assessment of the time-intensity curve (TIC) in an entire tumor ROI, possibly losing information on tumor spatial heterogeneity and local characteristics. When analyzing the pixel-level TICs of free NB-based CEUS, we observed a unique second-wave phenomenon: The first pass of the NB wave (bolus) is usually accompanied by a second wave in the time range of 3 to 15 min after the bolus injection. Such a phenomenon was shown to be potentially valuable in supporting the diagnostics of cancerous lesions. Procedures Seven male athymic nude mice were included and implanted with a tumor expressing PSMA (PSMA+) and tumors not expressing PSMA (PSMA-) on two flanks. Using either free NBs or PSMA-NBs, the characteristics of pixel-level TICs were estimated by a specialized model accounting for the two-wave phenomenon, compared with a conventional model describing only one wave. The estimated parameters by the two models were presented as parametric maps to visualize the PRE of PSMA-NBs in a dual-tumor mouse model. The effectiveness of the two models were also assessed by comparing the estimated parameters in the PSMA+ and PSMA- tumors through Mann-Whitney U test and quartile difference. Results Two parameters, the peak time and residual factor of the second wave, by the second-wave model were significantly different between PSMA+ and PSMA- tumors when using PSMA-NBs. Compared with the TICs of free NBs, TICs of PSMA-NBs present higher peak intensity and a more delayed second wave, especially in the PSMA+ tumor. Conclusions The estimation of parametric maps allows the estimation and visualization of specific binding of PSMA-NBs in PCa. The incorporation of the second-wave phenomenon enrich our understanding of NB kinetics in vivo and can possibly contribute to improved diagnostics of PCa in the future."

Although several Atriplex species have been investigated in depth, A. leucoclada, a halophytic plant native to Saudi Arabian desert, remains to be explored for its phytochemical content and biological potentials. Herein, the current study investigated the metabolic content and the anti-inflammatory potential of A . leucoclada. Methods Powdered aerial parts of the plant were defatted with n-hexane then the defatted powder was extracted with 80% methanol. n-Hexane extract (ATH) was analyzed using GC–MS, while the defatted extract (ATD) was subjected to different chromatographic methods to isolate the major phytoconstituents. The structures of the purified compounds were elucidated using different spectroscopic methods including advanced NMR techniques. Anti-inflammatory activity of both extracts against COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes were examined in vitro. Molecular docking of the identified compounds into the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes was conducted using pdb entries 6Y3C and 5IKV, respectively. Results Phytochemical investigation of ATD extract led to purification and identification of nine compounds. Interestingly, all the compounds, except for 20-hydroxy ecdysone (1), are reported for the first time from A. leucoclada , also luteolin (6) and pallidol (8) are isolated for the first time from genus Atriplex . Inhibitory activity of ATD and ATH extracts against COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes revealed concentration dependent activity of both fractions with IC_50 41.22, 14.40 μg/ml for ATD and 16.74 and 5.96 μg/ml for ATH against COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. Both extracts displayed selectivity indices of 2.86 and 2.80, respectively as compared to 2.56 for Ibuprofen indicating a promising selectivity towards COX-2. Molecular docking study supported in vitro testing results, where purified metabolites showed binding affinity scores ranged from -9 to -6.4 and -8.5 to -6.6 kcal/mol for COX-1 and 2, respectively, in addition the binding energies of GC–MS detected compounds ranged from -8.9 to -5.5 and -8.3 to -5.1 kcal/mol for COX-1 and 2, respectively as compared to Ibuprofen (-6.9 and -7.5 kcal/mol, respectively), indicating high binding affinities of most of the compounds. Analysis of the binding orientations revealed variable binding patterns depending on the nature of the compounds.

        "abstract": "The manuscript discusses the concepts of spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling in atomic physics and Molecular Quantum Similarity (MQS) in molecular clusters. spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling arises from the interaction between an electron's spin and its motion around the nucleus and electron–electron interaction and plays a crucial role in determining energy levels and spectral lines in atoms with heavy nuclei. On the other hand, MQS is a computational approach to compare the electronic density distributions in different molecular systems. In this order of ideas, the study aims to answer questions about electronic and structural differences caused by the spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling from the initial geometry [Steradians (SR) geometry] using the MQS framework. The MQS is based on the Molecular Quantum Similarity Measure (MQSM) using different positive operators such as Dirac delta and Coulomb operators to quantify the similarity between molecular systems. The paper presents tables with MQSM indices and Euclidean distances for different molecular clusters using initial geometry vs. geometry involved spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling. The scalar, spin–orbit and spin–spin relativistic coupling were incorporated using Amsterdam Density Functional code. The results show significant coupling of spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling on the similarity measures between different molecules. The manuscript suggests that understanding the relationship between spin–orbit and spin–spin coupling and quantum similarity could lead to deeper insights into electronic interactions in complex molecular systems and has potential applications in quantum mechanics and molecular physics."

It is crucial to achieve controllable synthesis for their successful integration into device technologies. In this study, we present the synthesis of phase-controllable 2D Cr_(1+ δ )Te_2 films on the Si (111) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. The composition and phase transition of the as-grown Cr_(1+ δ )Te_2 films are characterized by using in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and theoretical calculations. At low growth temperatures, by carefully adjusting the film thickness from 2 to more than 3 layers, we achieve precise control over the phase of Cr_(1+ δ )Te_2, from CrTe_2 to Cr intercalated Cr_2Te_3. At a relatively elevated growth temperature, it is demonstrated that the Cr_(1+ δ )Te_2 phase is independent of the film thickness, only Cr_2Te_3 forms and its growth mode is thickness-dependent. These phase transitions at low growth temperatures and growth mode changes at elevated growth temperatures are attributed to interfacial effects and the phase stability of Cr_(1+ δ )Te_2 compounds. Additionally, we utilize scanning tunneling spectroscopy and computations to gain insights into the electronic properties of Cr_2Te_3. The magnetic measurements reveal that the 30-nm Cr_2Te_3 film exhibits ferromagnetic behavior with a Curie temperature of about 180 K.

We conducted genome-wide association analysis of female and male farmed Japanese flounder ( n  = 24 per phenotypic sex) and found all regions of chromosome 24 to be significantly associated with phenotypic sex, suggesting it as the sex chromosome. Genetic sex was identified based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on chromosome 24 ( n  = 3568) using multidimensional scaling analysis, and individuals were clearly separated according to sex by the first dimension. The 61 SNPs most highly associated with sex were selected, and an amplicon-based SNP panel was developed. This was used to determine genetic sex of 39 females and 40 males. Eleven phenotypic males were assigned as female with XX genotype, suggesting sex reversal. Genetic sex was also assessed based on the indel of the amh gene promoter, which is the major candidate sex gene of Japanese flounder. We found four SNPs perfectly associated with genotypic sex in the sex-associated SNP panel, one of which was located in exon 2 of the amh gene. Along with the indel of the amh gene promoter, the sex-associated SNP panel will be of value in identifying genetic sex of farmed Japanese flounder.
